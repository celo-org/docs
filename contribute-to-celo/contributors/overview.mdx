Celo is open source and welcomes participation from everyone. We strive to be inclusive and empowering. All contributors must abide by Celo's [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).

## Ways to Contribute

Our community welcomes contributors with diverse skills:

- [**Code Contributors**](/contribute-to-celo/contributors/code-contributors) - Developers who improve Celo's protocol and infrastructure
- [**CIP Contributors**](/contribute-to-celo/contributors/cip-contributors) - Authors of Celo Improvement Proposals
- [**Documentation Contributors**](/contribute-to-celo/contributors/documentation-contributors) - Writers who create and maintain technical documentation

## General Contribution Guidelines

Whether you're contributing code, documentation, or other content, these principles apply:

- **Fork the repository** - Always work in your own fork before submitting changes
- **Use PRs for changes** - Pull requests are preferred, especially for small changes like typos
- **Work in branches** - Use feature branches, not master/main, for ongoing work
- **Submit regularly** - For non-trivial work, submit PRs regularly to get feedback
- **Quality matters** - Double-check your work before submission
- **Be objective** - Remain fact-based and neutral in tone

## PR Best Practices

For effective contributions:

- Create meaningful PRs with clear descriptions
- For works in progress, use "WIP" in the title
- Request appropriate reviewers (check CODEOWNERS when unsure)
- Explain dependencies and breaking changes
- Include relevant tests and documentation updates
