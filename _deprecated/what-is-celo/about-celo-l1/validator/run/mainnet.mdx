How to get a Validator node running on the Celo Mainnet.

<Warning>
This page describes the historical Celo Layer 1 blockchain. It is useful for understanding Celo’s history, but does not reflect the current state of the network. As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo has transitioned to an Ethereum Layer 2.

## What is a Validator?

Validators help secure the Celo network by participating in Celo’s proof-of-stake protocol. Validators are organized into Validator Groups, analogous to parties in representative democracies. A Validator Group is essentially an ordered list of Validators.

Just as anyone in a democracy can create their own political party, or seek to get selected to represent a party in an election, any Celo user can create a Validator group and add themselves to it, or set up a potential Validator and work to get an existing Validator group to include them.

While other Validator Groups will exist on the Celo Network, the fastest way to get up and running with a Validator will be to register a Validator Group, register a Validator, and affliate that Validator with your Validator Group. The addresses used to register Validator Groups and Validators must be unique, which will require that you create two accounts in the step-by-step guide below.

Because of the importance of Validator security and availability, Validators are expected to run a "proxy" node in front of each Validator node. In this setup, the Proxy node connects with the rest of the network, and the Validator node communicates only with the Proxy, ideally via a private network.
