How to verify the Celo Plumo Ceremony Phase 2.

<Warning>
This page describes how to verify the Plumo Ceremony Phase 2, related to the historical Celo Layer 1 blockchain. It is useful as a theoretical exercise, but Plumo is not in use anymore because as of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo has transitioned to an Ethereum Layer 2.

## Introduction

Plumo Ceremony Phase 2 had 10 rounds in total. Stored files for the ceremony are available [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/plumoceremonyphase2).

## Preparation

What you will need:

    - A Virtual Machine with at least 128 vCPUs and 864 GB memory (we used a `n2-highmem-128` VM in GCP).
        - Disk space of at least 10 TB.
    - The Plumo circuit, available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/plumoceremonyphase2/plumo_circuit_150v_143e) as `plumo_circuit_150v_143e`.
    - The initial file for Phase 2, available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/plumoceremonyphase2/phase2_init_27p) as `phase2_init_27p`.
    - The initial query file, available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/plumoceremonyphase2/new_challenge.query) as `new_challenge.query`.
    - The initial full file, available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/plumoceremonyphase2/new_challenge.full) as `new_challenge.full`.
    - The full transcript for Phase 2, available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/plumoceremonyphase2/transcript_backup_with_beacon/full_transcript.json) as `full_transcript.json`.
    - The [beacon hash](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-bls-snark-rs/issues/227), which was `50e6fa2d3e8ed9613bda92005c72193ebd6d0443d3c1b092ad9f569e531cc176`.
    - The snark-setup-operator [repository](https://github.com/celo-org/snark-setup-operator).

### Building the snark-setup-operator repository

In Ubuntu, you will need the `build-essential` package, as well as Rust version 1.63.0:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup toolchain install 1.63.0
rustup default 1.63.0
```

Now, assuming you are at the root of the `snark-setup-operator` repository, just run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Executing the Verification Crate

Once you have all the necessary files, and the Rust repository built, you can run (from the root of the `snark-setup-operator` repository):

```bash
$ sudo target/release/verify_transcript --phase phase2 --beacon-hash 50e6fa2d3e8ed9613bda92005c72193ebd6d0443d3c1b092ad9f569e531cc176 --transcript-path <PATH_TO_INITIAL_PHASE2_FILE> --phase1-powers 27 --phase1-filename <PATH_TO_FULL_TRANSCRIPT_FILE> --circuit-filename <PATH_TO_CIRCUIT_FILE> --initial-query-filename <PATH_TO_INITIAL_QUERY_FILE> --initial-full-filename <PATH_TO_INITIAL_FULL_FILE>

```

As the verification progresses, you will start seeing these lines:

```

{"timestamp":"Oct 22 03:54:24.767","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Finished verification successfully!"},"target":"verify_transcript"}
```

Once you see a line with the content `Finished verification successfully!`, the verification has finished.
