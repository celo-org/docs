title: Cross-Chain Messaging
og:description: Cross-chain messages facilitate communication and data transfer between blockchain networks.
---



Cross-Chain Messaging enables seamless communication and data transfer between different blockchain networks, allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to interact and share information across multiple ecosystems.

## Chainlink CCIP

[Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://chain.link/cross-chain) is a decentralized messaging protocol designed to enable secure and seamless communication between different blockchain networks. Built on Chainlink's proven oracle infrastructure, CCIP allows smart contracts to send and receive messages, data, and tokens across chains, facilitating cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi), interoperability, and multi-chain application development.

## Wormhole

[Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) is a decentralized cross-chain messaging protocol that enables the transfer of assets and data between different blockchain networks. It acts as a universal interoperability layer, allowing tokens, NFTs, and smart contract messages to move seamlessly across chains. Wormhole uses a network of decentralized guardians (validators) to securely verify and relay messages between blockchains.

### Supported chains

- Celo Mainnet
