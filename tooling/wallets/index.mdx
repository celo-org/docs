These wallets allow users to fully benefit from Celo’s native functionalities, such as [phone number mapping](/legacy/protocol/identity) and [fee abstraction](/developer/fee-abstraction).

The [Wallet Infrastructure](#wallet-infrastructure) section provides an overview of wallet infrastructure solutions you can integrate into your dapp to enable seamless web3 interactions for your users.

## Celo Native Wallets 

Build apps to be listed inside of these wallets and get access to more than 8 million wallets.
