Connect to nodes and services in the Celo Ecosystem.

---



## Run a Node

Running your own Celo node gives you direct access to the blockchain without relying on third-party services. This provides enhanced privacy, reliability, and control over your interactions with the Celo network. Follow [this guide](/infra-partners/operators/run-node) to set up and run your own RPC endpoint, which includes detailed instructions for configuration, deployment, and maintenance of your Celo L2 node infrastructure.

## Use a Community RPC Node

As part of the [migration from L1 to L2](/home/history), Celo Validators have become [Community RPC providers](contribute-to-celo/community-rpc-nodes/community-rpc-node.mdx).
They are discoverable through the following:

- Install [Celo CLI](/cli/) at version 6.1.0 or later. Then run: `celocli network:community-rpc-nodes`.
- [Vido Node Explorer](https://dev.vido.atalma.io/celo/rpc)
- [Celo Community RPC Gateway](https://celo-community.org/)
- [Stakely Celo RPC Load Balancer](https://celo-json-rpc.stakely.io)

## Forno

[Forno](/network/node/forno) is a cLabs hosted node service for interacting with the Celo network. This allows you to connect to the Celo Blockchain without having to run your own node.

Forno has HTTP and WebSocket endpoints that you can use to query current Celo data or post transactions that you would like to broadcast to the network. The service runs full nodes in non-archive mode, so you can query the current state of the blockchain, but cannot access the historic state.

## As a Service

Free and paid RPC endpoint hosting.
