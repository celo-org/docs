How to connect to Celo without running a full node using Forno.

---

## What is Forno?

Forno is a cLabs hosted node service for interacting with the Celo network. This allows you to connect to the Celo Blockchain without having to run your own node.

<Tip>
**Best-Effort Service**

Forno is a free service with no terms of service or uptime guarantees, and is rate limited. For production applications or as your usage increases, consider [professional RPC and node providers](/network/node/overview#as-a-service) that can provide the desired level of support (SLA).
</Tip>

Forno has HTTP and websocket endpoints that you can use to query current Celo data or post transactions that you would like to broadcast to the network. The service runs full nodes in non-archive mode, so you can query the current state of the blockchain, but cannot access historic state.

Forno is a public node, so to send transactions from a Forno connection you will have to sign transactions with a private key before sending them to Forno.

## Forno networks

Consult [this page](/network/) to determine which network is right for you.

### Celo Mainnet

```bash
https://forno.celo.org
```

Websocket support:

```bash
wss://forno.celo.org/ws
```

### Celo Sepolia Testnet

```bash
https://forno.celo-sepolia.celo-testnet.org
```

Websocket support:

```bash
wss://forno.celo-sepolia.celo-testnet.org/ws
```

### Websocket Connections & Event Listeners

Websocket connections are useful for listening to logs (events) emitted by smart contracts. However, Forno automatically disconnects websocket connections after 20 minutes.

When disconnected, you can reconnect to the websocket endpoint to continue listening for events. [This example script](https://gist.github.com/critesjosh/a230e7b2eb54c8d330ca57db1f6239db) demonstrates how to set up an event listener that automatically reconnects when the connection drops.
