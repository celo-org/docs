# Welcome

Welcome to the technical documentation site for the Celo project! You can check out the live site at https://docs.celo.org.

## Getting Started

This documentation site is built using [Docusaurus v2](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus).

You can run the site locally by cloning this repository, installing dependencies and starting docusaurus.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/celo-org/docs.git
cd docs
yarn
yarn start
```

Edit files in the `/docs` directory to make updates to the documentation pages. Pages will be automatically updated when you are running the development server.
