# Celo Documentation

Official documentation for Celo, built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com).

## üîç Documentation Validation

We have automated checks for errors and broken links that run on every push and pull request.

### Quick Validation

Before committing, run local validation:

```bash
# Run all validation checks
./scripts/validate-docs.sh

# Check for broken links using Mintlify CLI
mint broken-links
```

### CI/CD Workflows

- ‚úÖ **Broken Links Check** - Automatically scans for broken internal/external links
- ‚úÖ **Structure Validation** - Validates docs.json syntax and structure
- ‚úÖ **MDX File Verification** - Ensures all referenced files exist
- ‚úÖ **Syntax Checking** - Detects common MDX/JSX syntax errors
- ‚úÖ **PR Comments** - Automatically comments on PRs with validation results

See [DOCS_VALIDATION.md](./DOCS_VALIDATION.md) for complete documentation validation guide.

## Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation changes locally:

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `docs.json` is located:

```bash
mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Publishing changes

Install our GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) to propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes are deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

**Important:** All PRs must pass validation checks before merging.
