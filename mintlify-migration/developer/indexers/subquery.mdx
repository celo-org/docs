title: SubQuery
---

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralised applications in a faster and more efficient way.

Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics and multi-chain block scanners.

## Running and Hosting your Asset Chain SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:

- [Locally on your own computer or on your cloud provider of choice.](https://academy.subquery.network/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#locally-run-it-yourself)
- [By publishing it to the decentralised SubQuery Network](https://academy.subquery.network/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#publish-to-the-subquery-network), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers.
- [Leveraging a centralised hosting partner in the SubQuery community](https://academy.subquery.network/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#other-hosting-providers-in-the-subquery-community), like OnFinality or Traceye.
