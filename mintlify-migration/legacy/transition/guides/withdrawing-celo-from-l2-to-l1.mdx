title: Withdrawing CELO from L2 to L1
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to programmatically withdraw CELO from Celo Sepolia to Sepolia using the [viem OP Stack](https://viem.sh/op-stack).  

## Steps to Withdraw CELO

Withdrawals require the user to submit three transactions:

1. [Withdrawal initiating a transaction](https://viem.sh/op-stack/actions/initiateWithdrawal), which the user submits on L2.
2. [Withdrawal proving transaction](https://viem.sh/op-stack/actions/proveWithdrawal), which the user submits on L1 to prove that the withdrawal is legitimate.
3. [Withdrawal finalizing transaction](https://viem.sh/op-stack/actions/finalizeWithdrawal), which the user submits on L1 after the fault challenge period has passed, to actually run the transaction on L1.

## Code Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure a file with all the details you need for interacting with the Celo Sepolia.

    ```js index.js
    import {
      createPublicClient,
      createWalletClient,
      http,
      parseEther,
    } from "viem";
    import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
    import { celoSepolia, sepolia } from "viem/chains";
    import {
      publicActionsL1,
      walletActionsL2,
      walletActionsL1,
      publicActionsL2,
    } from "viem/op-stack";

    const account = privateKeyToAccount(
      "[PRIVATE_KEY]",
    );

    const value = parseEther("0.0001"); // Amount to Withdraw

    export const publicClientL1 = createPublicClient({
      chain: sepolia,
      transport: http(),
    }).extend(publicActionsL1());

    export const publicClientL2 = createPublicClient({
      chain: celoSepolia,
      transport: http(),
    }).extend(publicActionsL2());

    export const walletClientL1 = createWalletClient({
      chain: sepolia,
      transport: http(),
      account,
    }).extend(walletActionsL1());

    export const walletClientL2 = createWalletClient({
      chain: celoSepolia,
      transport: http(),
      account,
    }).extend(walletActionsL2());

    export default async function main() {
      console.log("Building Initiate Withdrawal...");
      const args = await publicClientL1.buildInitiateWithdrawal({
        account,
        to: account.address, // Receive on the same address on L1.
        value,
      });

      console.log("Initiaiting Withdrawal...");
      const hash = await walletClientL2.initiateWithdrawal(args);

      const initiateWithdrawalReceipt = await publicClientL2.waitForTransactionReceipt({
        hash
      });
      console.log(`Withdrawal Initiated: ${initiateWithdrawalReceipt}`);

      /**

      console.log("Waiting to prove...");
      const { output, withdrawal } = await publicClientL1.waitToProve({
        receipt: initiateWithdrawalReceipt,
        targetChain: walletClientL2.chain,
      });

      console.log("Building Prove Withdrawal...");
      const proveArgs = await publicClientL2.buildProveWithdrawal({
        output,
        withdrawal,
      });

      console.log("Proving Withdrawal...");
      const proveHash = await walletClientL1.proveWithdrawal(proveArgs);

      const proveReceipt = await publicClientL1.waitForTransactionReceipt({
        hash: proveHash,
      });
      console.log(`Withdrawal Proved: ${proveReceipt}`);

      /**
       * The below step can take a few minutes, ideally 2 minutes.

      */
      console.log("Waiting To Finalize...");
      await publicClientL1.waitToFinalize({
        targetChain: walletClientL2.chain,
        withdrawalHash: withdrawal.withdrawalHash,
      });

      console.log("Finalizing Withdrawal...");
      const finalizeWithdrawalHash = await walletClientL1.finalizeWithdrawal({
        targetChain: walletClientL2.chain,
        withdrawal,
      });

      const finalizeWithdrawalReceipt = await publicClientL1.waitForTransactionReceipt({
        hash: finalizeWithdrawalHash,

      console.log(`Withdrawal Finalized: ${finalizeWithdrawalReceipt}`)
    }
