## Isthmus

<Accordion title="My Alfajores node stalled at the Isthmus hardfork block (49908280)">

If you reached the hardfork block before upgrading to v2.1.0 your node can get stuck.

This can be resolved by upgrading both op-geth and op-node to v2.1.0, stopping
op-node, rewinding the op-geth head to before the hardfork and starting
op-node again.

To rewind the head you can use:

```bash
cast rpc -r <op-geth-node-address> debug_setHead 49908270
```
</Accordion>

## Mainnet

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My node is having trouble keeping up to date with the chain head / having trouble connecting to and finding peers">

A couple of issues could be causing this.

* If you are running multiple instances of op-node, make sure to check that they each have a unique and persisted private key at `--p2p.priv.path`
* Ensure that your node is accessible to other nodes, check the __Configure P2P for external network access__ section under [Running a full node](/infra-partners/operators/run-node#running-a-full-node)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I run a node or upgrade an existing node?">

See the guides for [running a node](/infra-partners/operators/run-node) or the guide on [how to migrate an L1 node](/infra-partners/operators/migrate-node).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to run my own EigenDA proxy?">

Yes. This is part of [running a node](/infra-partners/operators/run-node).
If you're using the [Docker Compose Setup](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-l2-node-docker-compose), it's included.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happened to funds on Celo L1 after the migration to L2?">

All balances have been carried over to the L2, unchanged.

<Accordion title="Is Celo able to support Solidity versions above 0.8.19?">

Yes, same as with Ethereum.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What data model changes happened in the RPC specs (esp. which gas tokens) between Celo L1 and L2?">

Have a look at the [changes from L1 to L2 in the specs](https://specs.celo.org/l2_migration.html#changes-for-json-rpc-users).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to Validators?">

Validators are becoming [Community RPC providers](/contribute-to-celo/community-rpc-nodes/community-rpc-node).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I see those [Community RPC providers](/contribute-to-celo/community-rpc-nodes/community-rpc-node)?">

There are multiple options.

* Install [Celo CLI](/cli/index) at version 6.1.0 or later. Then run: `celocli network:community-rpc-nodes`.
* [Vido Node Explorer](https://dev.vido.atalma.io/celo/rpc)
* [Celo Community RPC Gateway](https://celo-community.org/)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happened to governance, since the migration from Celo L1 to L2?">

[Governance](/about-celo/protocol/governance/overview) remains a pillar of the Celo blockchain. The Validator Hotfix process has been adapted, see [Updated Governance Hotfix](https://specs.celo.org/l2_migration.html#updated-governance-hotfix) for the changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happened to these features?">

* CELO token duality? Supported, see [Token Duality](https://specs.celo.org/token_duality.html).
* Fee currencies? Supported, see [Fee Abstraction](https://specs.celo.org/fee_abstraction.html).
* Epoch rewards? Epochs now work differently, but rewards stay, see [Epochs and Rewards](https://specs.celo.org/smart_contract_updates_from_l1.html#epochs-and-rewards).

<Accordion title="How is the Celo L2 different to Optimism?">

See [What's Changed Optimism -> Celo L2](/legacy/transition/optimism/op-l2).
Also see [Celo L2 Specification](https://specs.celo.org/root.html) for greater detail.
</Accordion>

See [What's changed section covering L1 fees](/legacy/transition/optimism/op-l2#l1-fees).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the block time?">

The block period is 1 second.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the throughput?">

The gas limit per block is 30 million, so the maximum throughput is 30M gas/s.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there anything that used to work on Celo L1 that doesn’t anymore on L2?">

See [What's Changed Celo L1 -> L2](/legacy/transition/whats-changed/l1-l2) and [L1 -> L2 Migration Changes](https://specs.celo.org/l2_migration.html) in the spec for greater detail.

## Testnets

<Accordion title="What’s the difference between Dango and Alfajores?">

Dango was a short-lived testnet forked from Alfajores at block [24940100](https://celo-alfajores.blockscout.com/block/0xc0e521a7b7326064ec12f51449de16d3218de161335daaa4ae8bbed1790b4a6c) to test the migration to L2. It was shut down in October 2024.

Alfajores is a long running Celo network testnet that was [launched in July 2019](https://blog.celo.org/introducing-alfajores-1b162ebcb44d) and  upgraded to L2 in September 2024.

See the [Alfajores network info here](/network#celo-alfajores-testnet).
