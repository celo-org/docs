In this guide you can explore tooling and infrastructure for building DeFi on Celo.

## Overview  

Stablecoins play a crucial role in decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing price stability, reducing volatility, and enabling seamless financial transactions. Celo has built an ecosystem optimized for stablecoins, making it a leading platform for real-world DeFi applications. With a focus on financial inclusion, building on Celo means enabling accessible and affordable financial tools for people around the world.  

## Why Stablecoins Matter  

Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to a stable reserve, such as fiat currency or a basket of assets. They provide key benefits in DeFi and financial transactions and financial inclusion:  

- **Price Stability** – Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins maintain a predictable value.  
- **Low-Cost Transactions** – Sending stablecoins on Celo costs significantly less than on traditional blockchains.  
- **Borderless Access** – Users can send and receive stablecoins globally, without needing a bank account.  
- **Programmability** – Stablecoins can be used in smart contracts to enable lending, savings, and remittances.  
- **Financial Inclusion** – Stablecoins empower unbanked and underbanked populations with access to digital financial services.  

Celo is uniquely positioned to advance the adoption of stable digital assets through the [Mento](https://www.mento.org/) Protocol—a decentralized stablecoin platform built on Celo. [Mento](https://www.mento.org/) enables the creation of local stablecoins that are algorithmically stabilized and backed by crypto collateral. This approach helps users access a price-stable digital currency that is aligned with their local economy.

The goal of Mento is simple: to provide a stable asset for every country in the world. These stable assets can be used for everyday payments, savings, remittances, and commerce—empowering individuals in regions with high inflation or limited access to traditional banking infrastructure.
