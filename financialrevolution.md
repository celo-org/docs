Introduction​

In this article,we will look at how blockchain technology can be leveraged to reimagine money to create the condition for prosperity for everyone.Lets dive in

The genie is out of the bottle, ready to serve us in transforming the economic power grid.

What would it take for blockchain technology to create a utopian future that would truly democratize finance?

The second iteration of the internet brought the world closer together, making it easier for people to trade and connect. Again, however, the need for trust brought about the rise of various intermediaries.

These intermediaries were doing a relatively okay job. However, cracks started showing up when too-big-to-fail financial institutions increased their appetite for risk by creating and investing in Mortgage-backed securities; thereby causing financial distress to average Joe's who had no clue of the undertakings of these banks; centralized institutions could, therefore, not be trusted. As if not enough, there was a lot of friction when sending money; this excluded so many people from financial services, locking a large population from accessing financial services.

What if we did not have to subscribe to an Orwellian future?


Prerequisites

​Here we will explore the golden eight financial services that blockchain will transform.

Rethinking Financial Services

1. Authenticating Identity and Value:

Mpesa-transactions here in Kenya are validated by Safaricom. While this was a step forward, we still needed trust to do transactions.

With blockchain, the barriers were lowered such that peers of the community could verify transactions by relying on cryptography and blockchain security. .

Celo Blockchain, for instance, has validators who collectively authenticate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.

1. Value:

The financial system moves trillions of dollars daily while trying to prevent the double spending problem. However, the system is so fragmented, bringing forth a lot of inefficiencies. Leveraging blockchain technology ensures that assets are moved in a unified manner improving speed, transparency, and efficiency. Transferring cUSD, for instance, on Valora, takes fractions of seconds, regardless of where they are.

1. Store of value:

Nzioki has been using his local bank to store money with the hope of the funds accruing an annualized interest rate. There is a better alternative on the blockchain. Valora wallet, built on the Celo blockchain, has Supercharge, where you can store cUSD, CELO, or cEUR. With the Supercharge, you get to receive rewards in the form of an interest rate which can be annualized up to 12%. We need not rely on banks.

1. Lending:

You need a credit score to access credit, but you need credit to have a credit score. Blockchain has a solid potential to solve that problem. For example, Moola Market, a lending protocol on Celo, recently partnered with Kotani Pay, an off-ramp service built on top of Celo, to do a pilot where farmers in Nanyuki, Kenya, could have access to a short-term loan. The idea was to award loans to members with a strong standing in the community, not necessarily a credit score, paving the way for smallholder farmers to have the chance to have access to cheap and efficient financial services. What if we could scale such initiatives?

1. Exchanging Value:

Blockchain technology cuts settlement times from all transactions from days to a matter of seconds. This allows the excluded population to participate in trading. The unbanked can effectively trade on ubeswap, a decentralized exchange built on Celo to buy and sell different assets, creating financial freedom and inclusion.

1. Funding:

What would it look like to democratize access to investing in enterprises and venture funding? The VC world was traditionally only meant for accredited investors, giving the top 1% the power to invest in the ideas they see fit to change the world. Additionally, you needed intermediaries to get matched with investors. The blockchain automates these processes, thus enabling new models of peer-to-peer financing and making the process more transparent and efficient.

1. Accounting for Value

The accounting industry is a multi-billion dollar industry that the big four accounting firms have majorly controlled. Since the blockchain is a distributed, append-only digital ledger, new accounting methods can leverage blockchain security, making financial reporting transparent and occurring in real-time; schemes like Enron (Enron's leadership fooled regulators with fake holdings and off-the-books accounting practices)

Would be impossible to pull off.

1. Risk Management and Insurance:

Uncertainty, as described by Nicholas Nassim Taleb, is bound to happen. Thus, human activity should be directed towards protecting oneself from uncertain loss. Blockchain technology supports decentralized insurance, making the insurance industry far more transparent. The insurer can leverage the blockchain to determine  a person’s reputational score based on reputational attributes. These can provide insurers more clarity allowing them to make more informed decisions.

Conclusion​

Blockchain technology may go through hiccups, and we may even fail, but I firmly believe that with the insights we have gathered about blockchain technology; we will iterate and reinvent it to serve its true purpose creating sustainable, inclusive communities that have a solid voice. With each leap forward, we will slowly but surely usher in the second era of democracy.
