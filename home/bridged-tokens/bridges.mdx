Bridging allows users to transfer assets between the Celo network and other blockchain networks. This section provides an overview of available bridging and swapping options.

<Warning>
Be sure you understand and review the risks when bridging assets between chains.

## Bridging To and From Celo

### Native Bridges

Native bridging refers to the process of transferring assets directly between the L2 (Celo) and the underlying L1 (Ethereum) without the need for intermediary networks or tokens.
This method is designed to be more secure, efficient and cost-effective, leveraging the security and scalability of L2 solutions.

- [Superbridge Celo Sepolia Testnet](https://testnets.superbridge.app/?fromChainId=11155111&toChainId=11142220)
- [USDT0](https://usdt0.to/): 1:1 transfers of native USDT powered by the Layer Zero OFT. Best for moving USDT

## Cross-Chain Messaging

In addition to token bridges, there are also protocols that enable cross-chain messaging and interoperability:
