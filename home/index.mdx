## What is Celo?

Celo is an Ethereum Layer-2 designed to make blockchain technology accessible to all. With its focus on scalability, low fees, and ease of use, Celo is ideal for building blockchain products that reach millions of users around the globe.

## Why Build on Celo?

Celo is fully EVM-compatible, offering the same development experience as Ethereum with improved scalability and lower costs.

#### Built for Everyday Users:

Celo is designed with features that lower the entry barrier for those new to cryptocurrency.

- [**Fee Abstraction**](/home/gas-fees): Users can pay transaction fees with several different tokens, making payments simple and flexible.
- **Sub-Cent Fees**: Celo maintains low gas fees, often below a cent, keeping transactions affordable.
- **Fast Transactions**: Celo achieves 1 second block finality, enabling near-instant transaction confirmations.
- **Native Stablecoins**: Celo provides native stablecoins like cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, eXOF, cKES, PUSO, and cCOP, offering a stable way to send and receive money. Check out [Mento](https://www.mento.org/) to learn more.
- [**Token Duality**](/home/protocol/celo-token#celo-token-duality): CELO token is both the native currency of the Celo blockchain as well as an ERC20 compatible token. This means CELO tokens can be moved both by doing a native transfer as well as ERC20 transfers and will show up in both in the native account balance and the ERC20 balance, no matter how they were transferred. In contrast to ETH/WETH, no token wrapping or unwrapping is necessary.
- **Mobile-Focused Approach**: Celo is optimized for mobile devices, making blockchain accessible to billions of smartphone users worldwide.

#### Optimized for Global Reach:

- **Global Distribution**: Build apps that scale to millions of mobile wallet users via [MiniPay](https://www.minipay.to/).
- [**Global Community**](/contribute-to-celo/daos): Connect with our extensive network of Celo Regional Hubs to bring your app to users around the globe.
