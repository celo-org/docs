  - Execute urgent security fixes via hotfixes.
  - Act independently in urgent situations for the network's best interest.

- **Decentralization Goals**:

  - Prevent any single entity from upgrading the system, modifying rollup state, or censoring transactions.

    - Ensures non-cLabs controlled quorum-blocking group.

- **Security Standards**:
  - Follow Optimism multisig security policy.
  - Allow nested multisigs if all signers adhere to the security policy.
