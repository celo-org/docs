With the [Jello Hardfork](/infra-partners/notices/jello-upgrade), Celo switched to use OP Succinct Lite and introduced a set of independent challengers. Those challengers are responsible for checking the validity of the state roots sent to the L1.

## List of Challengers

Currently, there are six registered challengers. Five challengers are independent entities, one challenger is run by cLabs.
