### Build a Farcaster MiniApp

Building a MiniApp comes with many benefits. You don’t need to manage on- and off‑ramp integrations, and the user experience is more seamless because your app runs inside a wallet client. For testing and scaling, we recommend keeping a standard wallet connection in your app; it should be hidden automatically when the app runs in a MiniApp environment. Our templates already include this setup, so we suggest creating your MiniApp using our starterkit, [Celo Composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer). Setting up a Farcaster MiniApp involves several specific settings, and our template provides a step‑by‑step guide to walk you through them.


Before you start building a Farcaster MiniApp, we recommend watching this video on how to build a successful MiniApp on Farcaster.

Make sure to also read the [Farcaster MiniApp documentation](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/). You’ll save a lot of time by reviewing it in detail before building. We also recommend testing a few popular Farcaster MiniApps to get a feel for UX patterns.


Use this command to scaffold a Farcaster MiniApp quickly using the [Celo Composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer):

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create --template farcaster-miniapp
```

When using this command, follow this workshop to configure everything correctly and avoid missing important implementations or settings.
