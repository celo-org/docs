In this guide you can explore tooling and infrastructure for building DeFi on Celo.

## Overview

DeFi on Celo is designed for builders who want to create accessible, stable, and inclusive financial systems. This guide walks you through the key tools and infrastructure available for developing decentralized finance applications on Celo.

Stablecoins are at the heart of DeFi, they provide price stability, reduce volatility, and power seamless transactions. Celo’s ecosystem is uniquely optimized for stablecoins, supporting real-world use cases that go beyond speculation. By building on Celo, you’re contributing to a global movement that makes financial access open and affordable for everyone.

Explore below how to integrate stablecoins, exchanges, and oracles into your next DeFi project.

## Why Stablecoins Matter

[Stablecoins](/build-on-celo/build-with-local-stablecoin) are digital assets pegged to a stable reserve, such as fiat currency or a basket of assets. They provide key benefits in DeFi and financial transactions and financial inclusion:

  Check out ["Build with
  Stablecoins"](/build-on-celo/build-with-local-stablecoin) for an extensive
  list of all stablecoins on Celo.
</Info>

- **Price Stability** – Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins maintain a predictable value.
- **Low-Cost Transactions** – Sending stablecoins on Celo costs significantly less than on traditional blockchains.
- **Borderless Access** – Users can send and receive stablecoins globally, without needing a bank account.
- **Programmability** – Stablecoins can be used in smart contracts to enable lending, savings, and remittances.
- **Financial Inclusion** – Stablecoins empower unbanked and underbanked populations with access to digital financial services.

Celo is uniquely positioned to advance the adoption of stable digital assets through the [Mento](https://www.mento.org/) Protocol—a decentralized stablecoin platform built on Celo. [Mento](https://www.mento.org/) enables the creation of local stablecoins that are algorithmically stabilized and backed by crypto collateral. This approach helps users access a price-stable digital currency that is aligned with their local economy.

The goal of Mento is simple: to provide a stable asset for every country in the world. These stable assets can be used for everyday payments, savings, remittances, and commerce—empowering individuals in regions with high inflation or limited access to traditional banking infrastructure.
