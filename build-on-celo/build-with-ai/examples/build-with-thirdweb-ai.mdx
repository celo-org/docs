## Get started building

### API Endpoint

The thirdweb AI API endpoint is:

```
https://api.thirdweb.com/ai/chat
```

### Authentication

Use your project's `secret_key` from the thirdweb dashboard for authenticated API calls:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.thirdweb.com/ai/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-secret-key": "<your-project-secret-key>",
  },
  body: {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Send 0.01 ETH to vitalik.eth",
      },
    ],
    context: {
      // Note: Chain IDs for thirdweb differ from standard chain IDs.
      // Find the correct chain IDs in the thirdweb dashboard or documentation.
      // https://thirdweb.com/chainlist/mainnets
      chain_ids: [8453],
      from: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    },
    stream: false,
  },
});
