# Vibe Coding Tools

Vibe Coding refers to an approach to software development where you use chat agents inside your IDE and build an application mainly by using prompts. This guide introduces you to a curated collection of tools that can significantly improve your development process, from full-stack application development to code editing and research.

Watch a quick intro to Vibe Coding with the Celo MCP Servers. You can find out more about them in the [MCP section](/build/build-with-ai/mcp/index).
