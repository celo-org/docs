## Agentic Activity with Real World Utility

Celo is a leading Ethereum Layer 2 optimized for agentic activity with real-world utility, enabling AI agents to autonomously perform onchain actions tied directly to payments, commerce, and financial coordination.

Agents on Celo can tap into the network's expansive payments ecosystem, leveraging fast finality, sub-cent transaction costs, and a stablecoin-optimized financial stack spanning peer-to-peer transfers, merchant payments, remittances, and onchain FX. Combined with native support for AI agent standards like [ERC-8004](/build-on-celo/build-with-ai/8004) and Celo's [Agent Skills](/build-on-celo/build-with-ai/agent-skills), Celo provides a production-ready environment for deploying AI agents that do more than trade tokens—they move money, coordinate economic activity, and interact with real users at global scale.

## Why Build AI Agents on Celo

On Celo, AI Agents can experiment and execute at scale. Celo's infrastructure is optimized for high-frequency, real-world transactions that AI agents rely on to operate autonomously and cost-effectively.

Key advantages include:

- **Fast finality and sub-cent transaction costs**, enabling agents to act continuously without prohibitive fees
- **Stablecoin-optimized design**, supporting payments, savings, subscriptions, and settlements across 25 stable assets tracking a wide range of local currencies
- **Mobile-first reach**, allowing agents to interact with users through wallets and apps used daily across global markets
- **Ethereum alignment**, giving agents access to the broader Ethereum ecosystem while operating in a purpose-built execution environment

This makes Celo uniquely suited for agentic workflows tied to commerce, coordination, and financial automation.

## What Is an AI Agent on Celo

An AI agent on Celo is a software system that can:

- Observe onchain and offchain data
- Make decisions using AI models or rule-based logic
- Execute transactions and contract calls autonomously
- Interact with users, wallets, and protocols without constant manual input

On Celo, agents are first-class participants in the economy. They can send and receive stablecoins, pay for services, manage balances, interact with DeFi protocols, and coordinate activity across multiple users and applications.

## Types of AI Agents

**1. Basic AI Agents**
- Simple tasks like chatbots with decision trees.
- Examples: Command processors, basic I/O automation.

**2. Functional Agents**
- Specialized agents with defined purposes.
- Examples: Code review agents, research assistants, or domain-specific solvers.

**3. Autonomous Agents**
- Operate with minimal human intervention.
- Capabilities: Multi-step reasoning, task automation, self-improvement.

**4. Multi-Agent Systems**
- Collaborative systems where agents work together.
- Examples: Collective problem-solving, distributed decision-making, or agent-to-agent communication.
