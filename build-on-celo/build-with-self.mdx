og:description: A comprehensive guide to understanding and using Self identity protocol on Celo
---

Self is a leading digital identity infrastructure for Web2 and Web3. Self leverages zero-knowledge cryptography to disclose verifiable credentials without revealing any sensitive information. No third parties. No data leaks.

<Info>
Self is the only leader in the space that is production-ready, live across iOS and Google Play Store, and fully audited by third-party zkSecurity that doesn’t rely on additional dependencies such as biometric hardware.

By the conclusion of this guide, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Self and how to integrate it into your Celo applications.

This document will cover:

- Use Cases

## What is Self?

[Self](https://self.xyz/) is a privacy-first, open-source identity protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs for secure identity verification.

It enables Sybil resistance and selective disclosure using real-world attestations like passports, EU ID cards, and Indian Aadhaar. With a few lines of code, developers can easily check if their users are humans, while preserving their privacy.

### How It Works

Self Protocol simplifies digital identity verification with zero-knowledge proofs in three steps:

1. **Scan Your Identity Document**: Users scan their passport, EU ID card, or Aadhaar using the NFC reader of their phone.
2. **Generate a Proof**: Generate a zk proof over the identity document, selecting only what you want to disclose.
3. **Share Your Proof**: Share the zk proof with the selected application.

## Use cases

Seamlessly and securely verify your digital identity with Self. It allows you to:

- **Prove Your Humanity:** Confirm you are human without revealing personal information.
    - Airdrop Protection
    - Social Media & Marketplaces (add trust to user profiles)
    - Quadratic Funding
    - Sybil-Resistant Polling
- **Prove Identity, Age, Nationality:** Demonstrate where you're from while maintaining privacy. Securely capture the first page data and RFID from your passport to verify your identity.
    - Sanction List Checking
    - Age Verification
    - Wallet Recovery
- **Privacy-preserving Technology:** Protect your users' private information. They will only disclose credentials and information that they allow.
- **Streamline Verification:** Enjoy a smooth and efficient identity verification process.
- **Optimized for Web3 and Universal Apps:** Harness zero-knowledge proofs and one-tap verifications in Web3 apps.

## New Features (2025)

### Expanded Identity Document Support

Self now supports:

- **EU Biometric ID Cards**: Scan NFC-enabled EU IDs covering 27 countries
- **Indian Aadhaar**: Support for Aadhaar verification
- **Passports**: Continued support for passport verification

All verification leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and no data leaves the user's device.

### Points/Rewards System

Self has introduced a points program that incentivizes consistent, secure use:

- Users earn points for setting up Self Pass
- Points earned for continued use across partner platforms
- Points can be redeemed for rewards
- Designed to drive engagement and validate active, verified users

### Major Integrations

- **Google Cloud**: Integrated Self's SDK and ZKP-based proof-of-humanity in its Web3 Portal
- **Aave**: DeFi protocol integration enabling compliance checks, sybil-resistant airdrops, and age/country-gated services
- **Celo Blockchain**: On-chain attestations leverage the Celo blockchain for transparency and auditability
