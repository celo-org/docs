sidebarTitle: "Nightfall Privacy Layer"
---

## Overview

**Nightfall** is an open-source, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) privacy layer developed by EY Blockchain that enables private transactions on Celo. As a Layer 3 solution on top of Celo, Nightfall brings enterprise-grade privacy to payments, supply chain finance, and B2B transactions while maintaining Celo's speed and low-cost advantages.

Celo is the **first payments-focused blockchain** to deploy Nightfall, combining private transactions with Celo's mobile-first infrastructure and 1-second block times.

<Note>
**Testnet Status**: Live and ready for testing

Nightfall testnet is currently active on Celo mainnet for developers and enterprises to build and test private payment applications.

**Full API documentation** is available in the [Nightfall GitHub docs](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_4_CE/blob/master/doc/nf_4.md#apis).
</Note>

## What is Nightfall?

Nightfall uses **zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-ZK rollup)** technology to batch private transactions into succinct blocks that are verified on-chain through cryptographic proofs. This means:

- **Transaction details are hidden**: Sender, receiver, and amounts remain private
- **Fast finality**: Achieves finality at the same speed as the underlying Celo blockchain
- **Low cost**: Private transfers typically cost around 6000 Gas (~90% cheaper than standard transfers)
- **Auditable privacy**: Transactions are cryptographically verifiable for compliance

## Key Features

### Privacy Technology
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Cryptographic privacy without trusted intermediaries
- **Layer 3 Architecture**: Runs on top of Celo L2 for maximum efficiency
- **Enterprise Access Control**: X509 certificate-based authentication

### Token Support
- **ERC-20**: Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) and other fungible tokens
- **ERC-721**: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard
- **ERC-3525**: Semi-fungible tokens

### Performance
- **Low Gas Costs**: ~6000 Gas per private transfer
- **Fast Finality**: Cryptographic finality matching Celo's block time
- **Scalability**: Transaction batching for efficient throughput

## Architecture

Nightfall operates with three main components:

### Client
The user-facing application that enables users to make private transactions. Clients interact with proposers and manage:
- Deposits (converting public tokens to private commitments)
- Transfers (private peer-to-peer transactions)
- Withdrawals (converting private commitments back to public tokens)

### Proposer
Network nodes that create Layer 2 blocks by batching transactions and generating zero-knowledge proofs. Proposers:
- Collect transactions from clients
- Generate ZK proofs for transaction validity
- Submit blocks to on-chain smart contracts

### Smart Contracts
On-chain contracts that handle:
- Token escrow for deposits and withdrawals
- ZK proof verification
- X509 certificate validation for access control

## Use Cases

### Private B2B Payments
Enable confidential business-to-business transactions while maintaining an auditable record for compliance. Ideal for:
- Invoice settlements
- Vendor payments
- Intercompany transfers

### Supply Chain Finance
Process payments across supply chain partners with privacy, reducing transaction costs and eliminating intermediaries.

### Enterprise Treasury Management
Manage corporate funds with confidentiality for strategic transactions, mergers, acquisitions, and sensitive operations.

### Cross-Border Payments
Leverage Celo's global reach and low fees with added privacy for international B2B flows, particularly valuable in emerging markets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To integrate Nightfall, you'll need:

1. **X509 Certificates**: Required for network access and authentication
2. **Ethereum Keys**: For signing transactions on Celo
3. **ZKP Keys**: For generating zero-knowledge proofs (must be directly available to the client)
4. **Node Access**: Connection to Nightfall proposer nodes

### Transaction Flow

#### Deposits
Convert public tokens on Celo into private commitments on Nightfall:
```
Public Celo Token → Nightfall Smart Contract (escrow) → Private Commitment
```

#### Transfers
Send private transactions between Nightfall users:
```
Private Commitment (sender) → ZK Proof → Private Commitment (receiver)
```

#### Withdrawals
Convert private commitments back to public tokens:
```
Private Commitment → ZK Proof → Nightfall Smart Contract → Public Celo Token
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Review Technical Documentation**: Start with the [Nightfall GitHub documentation](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_4_CE/blob/master/doc/nf_4.md)
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Install Nightfall client and connect to testnet
3. **Obtain Credentials**: Acquire X509 certificates for testnet access
4. **Deploy Test Application**: Build and test your integration on testnet
5. **Implement APIs**: Integrate Nightfall Client and Proposer APIs into your application

## About EY Nightfall

Nightfall was developed by **Ernst & Young (EY)** as an open-source privacy solution for public blockchains. The project has evolved through multiple iterations:

- **Nightfall_3**: Optimistic rollup approach
- **Nightfall_4**: Current version using cryptographic (ZK-ZK) rollups for instant finality

By deploying on Celo, Nightfall brings enterprise-grade privacy to a mobile-first, payments-focused blockchain infrastructure that already serves millions of users globally.

<Warning>
**Testnet Environment**

Nightfall testnet is for development and testing purposes only. Do not use real assets, production data, or sensitive information during testing. Testnet tokens hold no real-world economic value.
