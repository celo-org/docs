Contribute to Celo.

<!--truncate-->

## Open Source

Celo is an open source project and without community contributions from people like you Celo wouldn't exist. We welcome contributions to our [codebase](https://github.com/celo-org), [documentation](https://github.com/celo-org/docs), [translations](https://celo.crowdin.com/) and [blog](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/blog).

It can be difficult to find ways to meaningfully contribute to a new project, but writing a guest post on our blog is a great way to get started!

Write about your experience as a member of the Celo community, whether you're a CELO owner or a project founder. Your experience and perspective is valuable and can help others.

## Blog Ideas

Here are some topics that you could write about:

- Document your experience onboarding to Celo
- Share how Celo has impacted your life
- Using DeFi on Celo
- Minting tokens on Celo
- How to build a product or service on Celo
- How to debug transactions using the Truffle debugger
- Getting events using the Graph protocol
- How to contribute to specific Celo packages
- Project spotlights (your own project or researching another)
