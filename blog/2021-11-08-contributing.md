Contribute to the Celo blog.

<!--truncate-->

## Open Source

Celo is an open source project and without community contributions from people like you Celo wouldn't exist. We welcome contributions to our codebase, documentation, translations.

It can be difficult to find ways to meaningfully contribute to a new project, but writing a guest post on our blog is a great way to get started!

## Start with what you know

Writing about your experience as a member of the Celo community, whether a CELO owner or a project founder. Your experience is valuable and can help others.

## Blog Ideas

Here are some topics that you could write about:

- Document your experience onboarding to Celo
- How to debug transactions using the Truffle debugger
- Building a product or service using ContractKit
- Getting events using the Graph protocol
- How to contribute to specific Celo packages
- Minting tokens on Celo
- Using DeFi on Celo
- Project spotlights (your own project or researching another)
