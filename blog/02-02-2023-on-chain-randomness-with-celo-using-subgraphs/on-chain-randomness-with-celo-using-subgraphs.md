title: On-Chain Randomness with Celo using Subgraphs
description: The latest tutorial idea that I have is to create a lottery club, where users can establish their own lottery clubs with rewards of their choosing, including native coin (Celo), stablecoin (cUSD, cEUR, etc.) and also NFTs. In this idea, I will utilize Subgraph to index the smart contract of the lottery clubs created by users, and to ensure that the selection of winners for each lottery club will be determined by randomly generated numbers obtained from Celo Randomness, thereby reducing the potential for fraud in the process of selecting winners for each lottery club.

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how subgraphs and randomness work in the Celo blockchain. This tutorial will cover the use of subgraph technology to monitor blockchain activity and how to integrate random elements into your blockchain application. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a foundational understanding of how subgraphs and randomness can enhance your blockchain application and make it more engaging.
