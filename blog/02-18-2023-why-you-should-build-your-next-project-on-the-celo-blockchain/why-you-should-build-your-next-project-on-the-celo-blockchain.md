## What Can You Build on Celo?

Stablecoins, digital assets, and smart contracts are the major foundations for all projects which can be built on the Celo Blockchain.

### **Stablecoins**

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency with the value of the digital asset pegged to a reference asset, which is either fiat currencies, exchange-traded commodities, or another cryptocurrency. The Celo platform has its native stablecoin, the Celo Dollar (cUSD) pegged to the US dollar, and is designed to provide a stable and reliable currency for transactions on the platform. Other native stablecoins on the Celo platform are the Celo Euro (cEUR), and Celo Real (cReal) which track the value of the euro and the Brazilian real.

In addition, the Celo blockchain allows for the creation of custom stablecoins that can be pegged to any fiat currency. The use cases for Stablecoins on the Celo blockchain are endless and some include:

1. **Decentralized Applications (DApps):** Stablecoins can be utilized in DeFi applications, on the Celo blockchain, as a unit of account or as collateral to provide steady returns while lowering the risk of price fluctuation. This is particularly useful to lending and borrowing platforms, prediction markets, and decentralized exchanges.
2. **Rewards and Incentives:** Stablecoins are utilized as incentives and rewards for users that contribute to the Celo network in various ways, such as by providing liquidity or taking part in governance.
    For instance, the decentralized governance system on the Celo blockchain employs cUSD and other Celo stablecoins like cEUR and others for voting, giving token holders voting power proportional to the number of such tokens they have. This makes voting clear and safe and lessens how much market fluctuation affects decisions.
3. **Payments:** For both organizations and individuals, using stablecoins on the Celo blockchain for payments offers several advantages, including improved security, lower transaction costs, and quicker processing times. Hence on the Celo blockchain, stablecoins are utilized in a variety of ways as a form of payment such as in:
    * Cross-Border Payments.
    * Retail Payments.
    * E-commerce and online payments.
    * P2P Payments.

### **Digital Assets**

Digital assets on a blockchain refer to digital representations of value or ownership that are stored, transferred, and managed on a blockchain network. The most important use cases for digital assets on the Celo blockchain is the creation and management of stablecoins such as the cUSD as discussed above. But, that is only scratching the surface, with its fast, secure, and low-cost transactions coupled with Celo’s mobile-first approach, the Celo blockchain provides a convenient and accessible platform for people to manage and trade digital assets. Some use cases for digital assets projects that can be built on the Celo blockchain include:

1. **Custom Tokens:** The development of custom tokens, which may be used for a variety of reasons like fundraising, loyalty programs, or to symbolize ownership in a particular asset, is another use for digital assets on the Celo blockchain.

    The Celo blockchain is home to several custom token initiatives, one of which is the **Wasset Token ($WASS)** which is the custom token of the WassetDAO which is used for incentivizing members who are adding value through their waste recovery, recycling, and investment efforts. Also, it is the primary currency for staking in the WassetDAO and performing transactions on the Wasset marketplace.
2. **Digital Identity:** Digital assets on the Celo blockchain may be used for managing digital identities, enabling users to demonstrate their identities in a safe and verifiable way. This can be helpful for a variety of things, including voting or gaining access to financial services.
3. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes):** The Celo blockchain allows the development of decentralized exchanges, which would enable users to trade digital assets without the need for intermediaries. A good example of this is Ubeswap, a mobile-first DeFi exchange on Celo.
4. **Digital Asset Management and Custody Solutions:** Celo's secure and decentralized infrastructure enables the creation of digital asset management and custody solutions, providing investors with peace of mind and protection against theft and loss.

### **Smart Contracts**

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.

Smart contracts may be created on the Celo platform using Solidity, a high-level programming language that is frequently used to create smart contracts on Ethereum. Due to its emphasis on financial inclusion, the Celo platform also offers a stablecoin, cUSD, for use in smart contracts, providing price stability and lowering volatility.

More so; Celo runs the EVM which means that all smart contracts written for Ethereum can easily be deployed to Celo, the main difference being that you just need to connect to a Celo node instead of an Ethereum node. Some use cases for smart contracts projects that can be built on the Celo blockchain include:

1. **Decentralized Voting:** By utilizing smart contracts, decentralized voting systems may be created, allowing people to cast votes and make choices in a safe and open environment.
2. **Environment Monitoring:** Monitoring the environment allows for safe and transparent tracking of sustainability measures and environmental repercussions.
3. **Decentralized Asset Management:** Smart contracts on Celo may be used to create platforms for decentralized asset management, giving consumers secure and open options for managing their digital assets.
4. **Decentralized Gaming:** Smart contracts created on Celo can be used to build decentralized gaming platforms, enabling users to play games and trade digital assets securely and openly.

A very practical use case of a DApp(Decentralized App) project running on Smart contracts on the Celo blockchain is the impact market. Impact market is a social impact platform, that enables users to monitor the impact of their contributions to poverty alleviation initiatives and helps organizations that work in this area to raise funds more efficiently. By building on the Celo blockchain, Impactmarket has been able to ensure that the funds donated by users reach the intended recipients and are being used for the intended purpose, bringing transparency and accountability to the aid and development sector.

## Why Build on Celo?

The Celo platform, which focuses on financial inclusion, security, and accessibility, continues to draw more users and developers and is quickly emerging as a top platform for decentralized applications and smart contract projects. It has several competitive advantages over its rivals, which makes it a desirable platform for stablecoins, decentralized apps, and smart contract initiatives. Some of the key advantages of building on the Celo blockchain include:

1. **Speed:** The Celo blockchain is designed to provide fast and efficient transactions, allowing users to transfer digital assets and execute smart contracts in real time. This is due to Celo's consensus mechanism, known as Celo Proof-of-Stake (CeloPoS), which allows for quick and effective transactions, with block times of only 3-5 seconds. Additionally, Celo boasts a 1,000 transaction per second transaction throughput with a $0.00540 average transaction cost. As a result, Celo is among the most affordable blockchains.
