## Introduction

Interacting with the Ethereum protocol has been made easy with the advent of frameworks and libraries such as Web3py. Celo blockchain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine hence most tools for developing applications on the EVM are a good-to-go on Celo. For developers, it is important to be exposed to most of these tools if not all.

## Prerequisites​

I have designed this tutorial to help Celo-target developer understand how to use the web3py library to interact with smart contracts. Meanwhile, it is necessary to have experience working with the following areas.

- At least intermediate in Solidity.
- You must have been exposed to the Python environment, and should understand its syntax and concepts such as `classes` `functions`, `variables`, and `Object Oriented Programming` - `OOP`. 

## Requirements​
We are going to use the following tools. Please install them before proceeding.

- Code editor or an IDE preferably. I recommend [VSCode]().
- [Python](https://python.org/downloads)
- [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (No need to install separately if you installed Python3 or later version)
- [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

**What is Web3Py?**

Web3Py is a collection of APIs and utilities for interacting with the Ethereum-based platforms or nodes using IPC, HTTP, or WebSocket. It is the Python version of Web3js.

- Web3 : The umbrella class for the web3py package. It is a class object through which you can access or construct the Ethereum-related modules, versions, utils, providers, and givenProvider.

- web3.eth: This is used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain including smart contracts.

**Setting up development environment**

- Install [Python](https://python.org) if you don't have it.

- Install Python's package manager - pip. Before you do that, you'd want to check if pip is already installed by typing the following command in the command line.

```bash
pip --version
```
or

```bash
pip3 --version
```

If the command fails, **[this short video](https://youtu.be/Ko9b_vC6XY0)** will guide you through the installation.

- Install `web3py` using the package manager - pip.

```bash
pip install web3
```

- Create a project folder.
  - Launch Git bash. 

  ```bash
  mkdir <projectName> && cd <projectName>
  ```
  Replace `<projectName>` with the name you choose.

- In thesame path, create a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv <virtualEnvironmentName>
```

- Activate the environment

```bash window OS
source <environmentName>/Scripts/activate
```

```bash MAC/Linux
source <environmentName>/bin/activate
```

- Open in VSCode

```bash
code .
```

Now that we have everything set up, let's write the contract. Navigate to the root directory, create a `.sol` file, name it `ChequePayment.sol`, and paste the code below.

```bash
cd <root folder> && touch ChequePayment.sol
```

The above code is a simple cheque payment where an owner - _drawer_ can issue a cheque in favor of another party - _payee_. The party on whom the cheque is drawn is the smart contract acting as the bank called the _drawee_. The cheque can be valid over a stipulated period of time specified by the drawer at the time the cheque was drawn. If the time has elapsed, the payee will be denied the withdrawal of the cheque.

In the contract, the owner account is able to perform the following functions except for `cashout`:

- `drawCheque`: This is an `onlyOwner` payable function that accepts three arguments:

1. `payee`: address of the beneficiary.
2. `amount`: Value of the cheque.
3. `validityWindowInHrs`: The period through which the cheque remains valid.

In the `drawCheque` function, we called the `_safeGuardCheques` function which ensures the balances in the contract always tally with opened cheques. That way the `drawer` cannot issue a bounced cheque - a situation where the balances in the contract cannot cover the withdrawal at any time.

- `cancelDrawnCheque`
  An 'only owner' function that accepts the address of the payee as an argument. The successful invocation cancels all cheques drawn in favor of the `payee`.

- `increaseChequeValue`
  The account owner may wish to increase the cheque value for any valid addresses. The 'increaseChequeValue()' adds up to the value on the cheque for the target address. This is different from the `drawCheque()` that overrides the value in storage rather than increments it.

- `reduceChequeValue` performs a similar function as its counterpart - `increaseChequeValue` except that it reduces the value instead.

- `cashout`
  This function is callable by anyone for whom a cheque was drawn.

**Compile**
Compiling solidity files in Python is a little different compared to Javascript.

I have written a short script for this task. Make a new file in the project directory. Name it `contractInfo.py`. Then, paste the code below.

- To compile the contract, we will use a library called `solcx`.

```bash
pip install py-solc-x
```
- import `compile_standard` and `install_solc` from the `solcx` library.

- We use the `install_solc` function to install a specific version of the compiler ahead of compilation, read the solidity file, and compile using `compile_standard` based on the parameters we set. It then outputs a dictionary containing the compiled information. Thereafter, we create a file named `compiled_contract.json` where the result will be stored. We can then read the `abi` and `bytecode` from `compiled_contract.json`

```py contractInfo.py
  from solcx import compile_standard, install_solc
  import json

  with open("./ChequePayment.sol", "r") as file:
      chequepayment_file = file.read()

  install_solc(version="0.8.18")

  compiled_file = compile_standard(
      {
          "language": "Solidity",
          "sources": {"ChequePayment.sol": {"content": chequepayment_file}},
          "settings": {
              "outputSelection": {
                  "*": {"*": ["abi", "metadata", "evm.bytecode", "evm.sourceMap"]}
              }
          },
      },
      solc_version="0.8.18",
  )

  # print(compiled_file)

  with open("compiled_contract.json", "w") as file:
      json.dump(compiled_file, file)

  # Retrieve the bytecode
  bytecode = compiled_file["contracts"]["ChequePayment.sol"]["ChequePayment"]["evm"]["bytecode"]["object"]

  # Retrieve the abi
  abi = compiled_file["contracts"]["ChequePayment.sol"]["ChequePayment"]["abi"]

  # print(bytecode)
  # print(abi)

  GANACHE_CHAIN_ID = 1337
  ALFAJORES_CHAIN_ID = 44787
```

**Deployment**

Before deploying the contract, it is vital that we setup the network and provider. Paste the following code in `network.py`.

- `setUpProvider` returns a dictionary of providers locally and testnet.

- `selectNetwork` is a fancy way of choosing to interact locally via `Ganache` or a test network.

```py
  from web3 import Web3

  LOCAL_HTTPPROVIDER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8545"

  # Celo URI
  ALFAJORES_URL = "https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org"


  def setUpProvider():
      # To connncet to Ganache, we will set the HttpsProvider url to http://127.0.0.1 which run on port 8545
      local_provider = Web3.HTTPProvider(LOCAL_HTTPPROVIDER_URL);
      testNet_provider = Web3.HTTPProvider(ALFAJORES_URL)
      result = {"testNet_provider": testNet_provider, "local_provider": local_provider}

      return result

  def selectNetwork():
      isTestnet_provider = False
      try:
          selected = int(input("Enter: \n 0 to run in Ganache ... \n 1 on Alfajores ... "))
          if selected == 0:
              isTestnet_provider = isTestnet_provider
          else:
              isTestnet_provider = True
      except ValueError:
          print("ERROR: You need to enter an integer 0 or 1")
      return isTestnet_provider

```

`app.py`

- import utilities from other files.
- To send transactions, we will need the private keys. In Python, there are different ways of handling sensitive information. For us, we'll load the private keys from the environment using `dotenv`. If you don't already have it, install using the following command.

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

- Invoking `load_dotenv()` exposes the environment variables, and we can access them through `os.getenv`. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, and paste your private keys. 

>Warning! You're responsible for securing your private keys. Ensure that you include a `gitignore` file in the same path, and add the `.env` file to the `gitignore` to avoid accidentally committing sensitive information to Github. 

- The `provider`, `web3`, and `chainId` default to local instance. `isTestnetProvider` allows us to select between interacting locally or on testnet.  

- Sometimes, an address could be in mixed case and you may experience an `invalid address` error, `checksum` converts such to a valid checksum address.

- Sending a transaction that modifies the blockchain requires that we supply the transaction count of the calling address. This is to avoid replay attacks. We can access the number of transactions an address has done via `getNonce`.

- `convertToWei` accepts an integer and returns the formatted version in the smallest unit of Celo's currency.

- To broadcast transactions to the network, we need to pay some gas, and this requires the transaction sender to append their signature.  In this case, we need a wallet instance with private keys. `Account.create("ENTROPY")` returns a randomly generated account instance. It accepts a random string called `entropy`. By default, the wallet instances are set to a locally generated wallet.

>Note: The wallet instance by default contains the associated private key in raw bytes format. This is also the case with transaction hash returned in a transaction. You can convert to readable format using the `web3.to_hex` utils.

- The next code says if we are connected locally, we transfer funds from `ganache` to the locally generated accounts. Alternatively, you could simply import accounts from Ganache GUI.

- If the mode is `testnet`, we revert to using the live accounts from the keys stored in `.env` file.

- Next, create a class representation of the `ChequePayment` contract. At the constructor, we deploy the contract. Here are the stages involved in sending transactions which are common to all functions in the class.

  - Build the transaction.
  - Sign the transaction, and
  - Send the transaction to the network.

We have followed these steps in calling each of the functions in the contract except for `getOpenedCheques` which is readOnly and does not require a signature.

- The `build_transaction` function accepts a dictionary with transaction parameters. In our case, three of them are important to us. You could choose to manually set the `gas`, `gasPrice` etc. 

  - `chainId`
  - `from`
  - `nonce`

- To sign a transaction, we use `web3.eth.account.sign_transaction`, and parse the result from the previous step returned by `build_transaction`. This method is also good for offline transactions. It returned a dictionary containing detail of the transaction that was signed.

- The next step is to send the signed transaction to the network for approval. Call `web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_trx.rawTransaction)`, and give the raw data in bytes format as a parameter. Access the data from the result obtained in the previous step.

- Lastly, we use `web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt` to ensure that a transaction is confirmed and added to a block.

```py
  import os
  from web3 import Web3
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  from eth_account import Account
  from network import *
  from contractInfo import *

  load_dotenv()

Open a new terminal or split the current one into two if you're using a VSCode terminal. On one side, start the local blockchain by typing `ganache` in the terminal. This will start ganache.
In the second terminal, navigate to the project directory. On the VSCode GUI, be sure to be in `app.py` file, and click the triangular icon at the top right-hand corner to run the script.

Watch out for a popup in the terminal asking you to select 0 or 1. Selecting `0` will run the script on Ganache while `1` on Alfajores testnet. To run on testnet, be sure to connect to the internet.

Inspect the logs in the terminal. The balance on the opened cheques should read `0`.
