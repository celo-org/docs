The Prerequisites heading **must** be H1: # Prerequisites

This section is for you to explain any prior knowledge needed or any existing tutorials that need

to be completed first, any tokens that are needed, mention them here.

 

_For example:_

_ _


    ●     In this tutorial, we're going to build a Voting dApp on Celo so before we proceed further make sure to complete the first tutorial "Connect to Celo using hardhat".


    ●     Complete the Example Tutorial, first.


# **Requirements[​](https://docs.celo.org/community/celo-sage/tutorial-structure#requirements)**

The Requirements heading **must** be H1: # Requirements

OPTIONAL : Embed any video content in this section, if your tutorial has any.

Any technology that needs to be installed prior to starting the tutorial and that the tutorial will not cover (Metamask, node, truffle, etc). Do not list packages that will be installed during the tutorial.

 

_For example:_

 


    ●     We'll need Metamask in this tutorial, install it from[ HERE](https://metamask.io/).


    ●     Make sure to have NodeJS 12.0.1+ version installed.


# **Body of the Tutorial[​](https://docs.celo.org/community/celo-sage/tutorial-structure#body-of-the-tutorial)**


    ●     Please do not use "Body of the Tutorial" as a heading, use your own heading that is relevant to the material. "Getting started" is acceptable if you can't think of anything else 😉


    ●     Add any text content necessary to guide readers through your tutorial, and remember to proofread your content for spelling and grammar before you submit your tutorial.[ Grammarly](http://grammarly.com/) is a good free program that can help you to avoid spelling and grammar problems.

 

Points to remember:

 


    ●     Keep all subheadings at H2, don't go into H3 or lower:


    ●     Add only necessary comments in code blocks. Do not add # style comments to terminal input code blocks.


    ●     Add all relevant code blocks:


    ●     Markdown syntax for code blocks is three backticks at the beginning and the end of the code block. Also make sure that all code blocks have a newline before and after the backticks. _For example:_

_ _


```
 ```js
 const testVariable = 'some string';
 someFunctionCall();
 ///```
```


 


    ●     ALL code blocks must have a syntax highlighting type, use ```text if you are not sure.


    ●     ```bash should only be used for code blocks where you need to have # style comments. This must be done carefully because in many situations the # character will render as a markdown heading.


    ●     Do not use pre-formatted text for emphasis - only use **bold** or _italic_ text for emphasis.


    ●     Add Images or code blocks to reflect expected terminal output.


    ●     Take an error-driven approach when writing your tutorial: Add common errors and steps to troubleshoot the errors, for example:

 

**|** **Not able to connect to the Celo Node, getting an error on executing node connect.js**

 

Let's check for some common causes: First, make sure you have the .env file saved and it's in the correct format as given in the tutorial.

 

If you're getting an error message like UnauthorizedError: {"message": "Invalid authentication credentials"} then make sure to replace the &lt;API_KEY> with your correct API key which you copied from the DataHub Dashboard.

 

Make sure to have the .env file saved in your project root folder.

Make sure NODE_URL in the .env file is correct.

This section should summarize what was learned in the tutorial, reinforce key points and also congratulate the learner for completing the tutorial. Use a maximum of 5-6 lines.


# **Next Steps[​](https://docs.celo.org/community/celo-sage/tutorial-structure#next-steps)**

The Next Steps heading **must** be H1: # Next Steps

 

Use this section to explain what can be done next after this tutorial for continued learning. Feel free to add recommended projects and articles here which are related to this tutorial. If you're working on any other advanced tutorials, you can briefly mention them here.


 

 

Celo is a mobile-first blockchain network designed to create an open financial system that is accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. Celo has gained a lot of attention in the blockchain space due to its unique consensus mechanism, which aims to provide fast and secure transactions while maintaining decentralization.

Consensus is a fundamental concept in blockchain technology, and it refers to the process of agreeing on the state of the network among all the nodes. In a distributed system like a blockchain, nodes are decentralized and must reach consensus without relying on a central authority. Celo's consensus mechanism, called the Proof of Stake with Identity (PoS-Id) consensus algorithm, is designed to achieve this goal.

In this article, we will take a deep dive into Celo's PoS-Id consensus mechanism and explore how it works.

What is PoS-Id Consensus Algorithm?

The PoS-Id consensus algorithm is a variation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism used by many blockchain networks, including Ethereum. In the PoS consensus mechanism, validators are chosen based on their stake in the network, and they are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks.

Celo's PoS-Id consensus algorithm takes this concept further by incorporating identity verification as a crucial component of the consensus process. In the PoS-Id consensus algorithm, validators are not only chosen based on their stake in the network, but they must also prove their identity to participate in the consensus process.

Validators are required to provide a phone number, and this number is used to verify their identity. Validators must also provide a minimum stake in CELO tokens to participate in the consensus process. This stake is used to secure the network, and validators are rewarded for their participation in the consensus process.

The PoS-Id consensus algorithm is designed to provide a high level of security while maintaining decentralization. The identity verification requirement ensures that only trusted validators are chosen to participate in the consensus process. This helps to prevent attacks such as Sybil attacks, where a single user can create multiple identities to gain control of the network.

How does PoS-Id Consensus Algorithm work?

The PoS-Id consensus algorithm works by selecting validators to participate in the consensus process based on their stake in the network and their verified identity. Validators are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks.

The consensus process begins with a validator proposing a new block. The proposed block contains a set of transactions that have been verified by the validator. Other validators then validate the block by checking that the transactions are valid and that the proposed block is consistent with the current state of the network.

If a validator detects an error or inconsistency in the proposed block, they can reject it. However, if a consensus is reached, the proposed block is added to the blockchain, and the validator who proposed the block is rewarded with CELO tokens.

Validators are incentivized to participate in the consensus process and act honestly because they stand to lose their stake if they are found to be acting maliciously. In addition, validators are subject to a slashing mechanism, where a portion of their stake is forfeited if they are found to have violated the network's rules.

The PoS-Id consensus algorithm is designed to be fast and scalable, with the ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. The algorithm achieves this by utilizing a mechanism called a "commit/reveal" scheme, where validators reveal their block proposals only after a commit phase, reducing the potential for malicious behavior.

Conclusion

Celo's PoS-Id consensus algorithm is a unique approach to consensus in blockchain technology. By incorporating identity verification as a crucial component of the consensus process, Celo's PoS-Id consensus algorithm provides a high level of security while maintaining decentralization. Validators are incentivized to act honestly, and malicious behavior is penalized,

Celo is a blockchain platform designed to bring financial access to people around the world who lack it. One of the key features of Celo is its consensus mechanism, which is used to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. In this article, we will take a deep dive into Celo's consensus mechanism, exploring how it works and what makes it unique.

Before we dive into Celo's consensus mechanism, it's important to understand what consensus means in the context of blockchain technology. Consensus is the process by which a distributed network of computers comes to agreement on the validity of transactions and the state of the blockchain. Without a robust consensus mechanism, a blockchain network can be susceptible to various forms of attack, such as double-spending or 51% attacks.

Celo's consensus mechanism is based on a modified version of the Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm. PoS is an alternative to the more well-known Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, which is used by Bitcoin and other early blockchain platforms. PoS is designed to be more energy-efficient and scalable than PoW, as it doesn't require miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to validate transactions.

In Celo's PoS-based consensus mechanism, validators stake Celo's native token, CELO, in order to participate in the consensus process. Validators are chosen based on their stake size and their reputation within the network. This reputation is based on a combination of factors, including their uptime, their history of successful validation, and their adherence to the network's rules and protocols.

Validators take turns proposing blocks of transactions to add to the blockchain. Once a block is proposed, other validators in the network have a certain amount of time to verify the transactions and validate the block. If the block is validated, it is added to the blockchain, and the validator who proposed the block is rewarded with CELO tokens.

One of the unique features of Celo's consensus mechanism is the concept of "locked gold". Locked gold is a separate token that is used to provide additional security to the network. Validators can lock their CELO tokens in order to generate locked gold, which they can then use as collateral to guarantee their behavior within the network. If a validator behaves maliciously or violates the network's rules, their locked gold can be confiscated and distributed to other validators as a penalty.

Another key feature of Celo's consensus mechanism is the ability to participate in governance decisions. CELO token holders can vote on proposals for changes to the network's protocols and rules. This allows the network to evolve over time in response to the needs and desires of its users.

Overall, Celo's consensus mechanism is designed to be efficient, secure, and scalable, while also allowing for participation and governance by its users. By using a modified version of the PoS algorithm and introducing the concept of locked gold, Celo is able to provide a robust and reliable consensus mechanism that helps to ensure the integrity of the blockchain. As Celo continues to grow and evolve, its consensus mechanism will undoubtedly play a critical role in its success.
