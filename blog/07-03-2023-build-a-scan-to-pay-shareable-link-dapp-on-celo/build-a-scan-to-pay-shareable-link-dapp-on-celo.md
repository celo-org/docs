## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a Scan-to-Pay Shareable Link dApp on the Celo blockchain. With this dApp, users can quickly and easily pay for goods and services by simply scanning a shareable payment link using their mobile devices.

Using Celo's decentralized platform for mobile payments, we will guide you through the process of building a smart contract and a web app that generates shareable payment links. We will also show you how to enable users to complete payments by scanning those links with their mobile devices.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced blockchain developer, this tutorial will provide you with a comprehensive guide on building a Scan-to-Pay Shareable Link dApp on Celo. So let's dive in and get started!

## Prerequisitesâ€‹

Before you begin this tutorial, there are a few prerequisites you should have:

1. Basic programming knowledge: You should have some familiarity with programming concepts and basic coding skills. This tutorial assumes that you have a working knowledge of React JS.

2. Familiarity with Celo blockchain: While it's not strictly necessary to have prior experience with Celo, it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of the Celo blockchain and its components, such as the Celo Valora wallet, MetaMask, and the Celo network.

3. Development environment: You'll need a development environment set up on your machine. We recommend using Visual Studio Code as your code editor, Node.js and NPM / Yarn for installing dependencies, and Git for version control.

4. Celo wallet: You'll need a Celo wallet to interact with the Celo network. You can create a Celo wallet using the Valora app, which is available for download on the App Store and Google Play. Alternatively, you can use MetaMask mobile wallet too.

5. Celo Testnet account and test tokens: You'll need a Celo Testnet account to test your dApp. You can obtain test tokens from the Celo faucet [here](https://celo.org/developers/faucet), which will enable you to interact with the Testnet.

If you meet these prerequisites, you're ready to get started building your Scan-to-Pay Shareable Link dApp on Celo!

## Requirements

1. Node.js and NPM: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that allows you to easily install and manage dependencies. You can download Node.js and NPM from the official website: [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Vite: Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool that is designed to work with modern JavaScript frameworks like React. You can install Vite using NPM by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install -g vite`.

3. Ethers.js: Ethers.js is a JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum-based blockchains like Celo. You can install Ethers.js using NPM by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install ethers`.

4. Code editor: You will need a code editor to write and edit your code. We recommend using Visual Studio Code, which is a free, open-source code editor with excellent support for JavaScript development. You can download Visual Studio Code from the official website: [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

5. Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style your web applications. You can install Tailwind CSS using NPM by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install tailwindcss`.

By installing these packages and tools, you will have everything you need to complete the tutorial and build your Scan-to-Pay Shareable Link dApp on Celo using Vite, React, and Ethers.js.

## Setting up the starter code

You can clone the starter code from GitHub and get set up with all the required packages for the tutorial.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JovanMwesigwa/scan-qr-to-pay-shareable-link-dapp.git
```

This will clone the starter project to your local development environment.

Open the project in your favorable IDE, and install the dependencies with:

```bash
 yarn or npm install.
```

In your terminal, type `yarn run dev`to run the project in your browser.

Here's what you should have so far:

![initial-ui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380034-73cde6be-8ad9-40d7-ad38-12cc0d8f53dd.png)

### The src folder structure

The `src` folder has the `/pages` folder where we have the main `Dashboard.jsx` page. This will simulate a merchant management dashboard for creating and managing product links.

In the same folder, we have the `Pay.jsx` page that will display the QR code that will allow users to scan to pay. All the shareable links shared by the merchants will land on this page.

### Exploring the Dashboard starter code

Inside the `Dashboard.jsx` file under the `/pages` folder, we have some library imports at the top:

```js
import { useState } from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
```

We import the `useState` function from `react` to handle multiple state changes in the page and `useNavigate()` from `react-router-dom`.

```js
const Dashboard = () => {
  const [address, setAddress] = useState('')
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0.0)
  const [error, setError] = useState('')

  const [linkData, setLinkData] = useState(null)
```

Using `useState` we handle several useful state variables on the page:

- address: This will be the merchant's address to receive payment.
- amount: The amount of CELO that the merchant intends to receive from a pay link.
- error: To catch and display any error messages that may result from a failed response and feedback.
- linkData: Handle the created link from the merchant's entered information.

On the form inputs:

```js
    <label htmlFor="address" className="text-sm text-gray-400 ">
        Paste your address
    </label>
    <input
        type="text"
        value={address}
        onChange={(e) => setAddress(e.target.value)}
        className="w-full border-1 py-4 outline-none border-gray-900"
    />
```

On the address form input element we set the `value` prop to the `address` state variable and the `onChange()` method to update the `address` state.

This is the same logic we used for the `amount` form input element. As shown below:

```js
    <label htmlFor="addredd" className="text-sm text-gray-400 ">
      Enter CEL Amount
    </label>
        <input
          type="number"
          value={amount}
          onChange={(e) => setAmount(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="0.0"
          className="w-1/2 border-[0.5px] py-2 rounded-md px-2 mt-2 outline-none border-gray-100"
        />
```

The `amount` form input elements update the `amount` state, as defined in the code above.

Closing off the form is the button that generates the code by calling the `generateLink()` that we'll define later on:

```js
<button
  onClick={generateLink}
  className="bg-green-600  my-4 w-full p-3 rounded-md text-white"
>
  Generate QR Link
</button>
```

After generating the payment link, we want to display it so that the merchant can see and copy it.
To do this, we've defined a clickable `div` link that we make sure only populates when the link is generated, as shown below:

```js
{
  linkData && !error && (
    <div onClick={openPayLink} className="text-xs text-blue-400 cursor-pointer">
      Open QR link
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `openPayLink` is a method that when clicked, will navigate the user to a payment page with a scannable link QR code.

### Generate Link

The Generate QR Link button directly calls the `generateLink` function below:

```js
const generateLink = () => {
  if (!address || amount === 0) {
    setError("Make sure you complete all fields!");
    return;
  }

  setError("");

  const data = { address: address, amount: amount };
  const encodedData = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data));

  setLinkData(encodedData);
};
```

The function, first verifies that all forms have been populated with information and that the user is not submitting empty information.

Inside the pay link URL, we need to pass in the merchant's address and the amount of CELO that they are accepting for payment. These are passed inside that pay link URL that will be shared.

For React to allow us to pass the data object as props in the URL, we need to stringify the data from an object to a string.

As shown in the line:

```js


    const data = { address: address, amount: amount }
    const encodedData = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data))

    setLinkData(encodedData)
  }


```

Finally, we define the `openPayLink` function that will allow the merchants to navigate to the pay page by passing in the link params in the URL.

```js
const openPayLink = () => {
  navigate(`pay/${linkData}`);
};
```

### Exploring the Pay page

The `Pay.jsx` is a very simple page. It only extracts the address and amount from the URL parameters and displays them in a QR element in the browser.

To see this page, enter an address and amount in the dashboard page, press generates link button, and click the `Open QR link` link above the button.

As shown below:

![paypage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380163-3288a445-5c46-44c9-9325-e302343c89ba.png)

### Scan to pay functionality

At the top of the `Pay.jsx` file, we have several libraries imported:

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import EthereumQRPlugin from "ethereum-qr-code";
import QRCode from "qrcode.react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
```

1. `EthereumQRPlugin`: When we created the transaction to be signed by the user's wallet, all the QR code does is hold the created transaction instance that the user's wallet will sign to make the payment. The `ethereum-qr-code` package helps to transform the transaction data into `dataUrl` for the user's wallet signs. It's installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-qr-code) and helps to hold the signable transaction instance.
2. `QRCode`: The generated `dataUrl` from `ethereum-qr-code` is displayed to the UI using the `qrcode.react` package.
3. `useParams`: To extract the information about the required transaction from the link-URL, we use the `useParams` method from `react-router`.
4. `ethers`: This will help us convert the amount to Wei.

The first thing we need to do is extract the merchant's address and pay the amount from the URL and parse it.

```js

const Pay = () => {
  const { session } = useParams()
  let decodedData = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(session))
```

Defining a `qrData` state variable will allow us to save the instance of the created transaction to be signed.

```js
const [qrData, setQrData] = useState();
```

As soon as the user navigates to the payment page, we assume that they are ready to scan the QR code with their mobile phone. So we need immediately display the QR on the page.

To achieve this, we define a `generateQrCode` function and call it in the useEffect function, so the code is generated on the initial render of the page.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  generateQRCode();
}, [decodedData]);
```

Using `decodedData` as a dependency in `useEffect` will allow the page to update whenever there's a change in the link parameters.

### Generate QR Code

The `generateQrCode` function uses the `ethereum-qr-code` `.toDataUrl()` method to generate a URL of the transaction.

`toDataUrl` takes in a transaction object similar to what ethers js does with the transaction object, where we define the merchant's address, value, and the chainId of the network that will hold the transaction. In this case, we're using celo's test network alfajores which has a chainId of 44787.

This then handles a promise using the `.then()` where we successfully set the created code to the `qrData` state variable.

As shown in the code:

```js
const generateQRCode = async () => {
  const qrData = qr.toDataUrl({
    to: decodedData.address,
    value: ethers.parseEther(decodedData.amount),
    chainId: 44787,
  });

  qrData.then((code) => {
    console.log("Your QR id generated:", code.value);
    setQrData(code.value);
  });
};
```

Testing out the code:

![log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380276-90b3ebde-5654-42ac-b594-50c323940567.PNG)

On the initial page render, the `generateQRCode` function is called and a dataUrl is created and logged in the console.

Code Created Output:
![qrcode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380347-50a5695a-2ab4-4def-9935-6ffbed81de98.png)

The paid link is successfully creating a scannable pay link QR code.

### Scanning the code

Let's try to scan the code with a mobile wallet.

Depending on the wallet that you are using, make sure that it's connected to the required network that you're testing from. In my case, am using meta mask's mobile wallet from PlayStore because it supports the Celo alfajores network.

You also need to have a few funds in your mobile wallet for the transaction to successfully go through. You can get from Celo's test faucet [here](https://faucet.celo.org/)

Using the metaMask account in chrome as the merchant with an initial balance of 0.2CELO.

![merchantbalance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380423-ec7656cf-f061-4f3c-993e-4985eef5f625.PNG)

And the user's mobile wallet on android, with a balance of 11.81229 CELO

![userbalance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380472-f89635bd-933b-4785-b587-470cecd612af.jpg)

Let's try to create a payment link of 0.5CELO from the merchant, and then pay it from the mobile app.

This successfully creates a QR code, that can be signed using the mobile wallet.

![paidqr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380544-0dfa684d-221f-4634-950d-845aacf1806a.png)

On scanning the code, we're given a summary of the transaction details with the merchant's address, balance, transaction cost, and gas price:

![confirmtx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380592-d73833b4-0ca0-48ab-9314-28f6791ee86b.jpg)

When we confirm the transaction:

![txsent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380643-b632e603-3666-42ad-8776-6cd8f931200e.jpg)

The transaction was successful!

We can see the merchant's wallet has received all the 0.5CELO in their browser wallet.

![finalbalance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62109301/223380688-3a3d8154-09bb-469e-932f-f29fe0bbac87.PNG)

The transaction we successfully registered on the block explorer:
Tx Hash: [0x7d9..ceb6](https://alfajores.celoscan.io/tx/0x7d925078e51cc602cc48897049bd70cb977cafc9bcadf594aebd9e5816a7ceb6)
