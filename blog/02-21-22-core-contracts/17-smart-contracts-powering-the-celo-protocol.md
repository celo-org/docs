# 17 Smart Contracts Powering the Celo Protocol

_Making sense of the logic driving the Celo platform._

![header](../../src/data-tutorials/showcase/intermediate/17-smart-contracts-powering-the-celo-protocol.png)

## Hello Developers üå±

Welcome to today‚Äôs post, where we‚Äôll break down a blockchain topic into bite-sized pieces to help you learn and apply your new skills in the real world.

Today‚Äôs topic is _Celo Core Contracts_.

**Here‚Äôs an overview of what we‚Äôll cover üóí**

- ‚úÖ What is the Celo Protocol?
- ‚úÖ Celo Core Contracts
- ‚úÖ Navigating contract resources
- ‚úÖ Core Contract Details

By the end of this post, you‚Äôll be able to navigate many of the Celo Core Contracts and have the tools to explore the Celo protocol.

Let‚Äôs go! üöÄ

## What is the Celo Protocol?

The [Celo](https://celo.org/) protocol is a fully [EVM compatible](https://medium.com/celoorg/donut-hardfork-is-live-on-celo-585e2e294dcb), [proof-of-stake](https://medium.com/celoorg/celos-proof-of-stake-mechanism-31061fbebea), [carbon-negative](https://medium.com/celoorg/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490), layer-1 protocol, featuring a fast ultralight client and built-in seigniorage stablecoins, collateralized by crypto and natural assets.

## The Celo Full-Stack Solution

Celo provides a full-stack blockchain solution where each layer is designed to ensure the speed, security, and stability of every application built on the Celo platform.

The Celo Blockchain is an open cryptographic protocol that allows applications to make transactions and run smart contracts. A growing collection of Celo Core Contracts run on the Celo Blockchain defining the platform logic including ERC-20 stable currencies, identity attestations, proof-of-stake, and governance. These contracts are used by developers build Applications that take advantage of innovations in the Celo Protocol.

## Celo Core Contracts

The **Celo Core Contracts** are divided into four main groups: [common](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/common), [governance](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/governance), [identity](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity), and [stability](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/stability). Each has its own folder and is available in the contracts folder.

The [common](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/common) folder holds files used throughout the protocol including the registry, utilities, and the CELO native asset. The [governance](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/governance) folder handles validator elections, proposals, and rewards. The [identity](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity) folder handles functions that link accounts to cell phones or other unique identifiers. Finally, the [stability](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/stability) folder manages Celo stable coin functions including the reserve and on-chain exchanges.

## Contract release process

Changes to core smart contracts are made using on-chain Governance approximately four times a year. When a release is made, all smart contracts from the release branch that differ from the deployed smart contracts are released and included in the same governance proposal.

## Secure smart contracts with OpenZeppelin

[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) provides a service to verify smart contract security by performing smart contract audits. Celo has received and implemented all feedback from the thorough audit reports provided by the OpenZeppelin engineering team to ensure the security of their contracts.

# Congratulations üéâ

That wraps up today‚Äôs topic on _Celo Core Contracts_. You can review each of the items we covered below and check that you‚Äôre ready to apply these new skills.

**Here‚Äôs a quick review of what we covered ü§î**

- ‚úÖ What is the Celo Protocol?
- ‚úÖ Celo Core Contracts
- ‚úÖ Navigating contract resources
- ‚úÖ Core Contract Details

Explore the code, unit tests, block explorer, documentation for any contract you find in the [contracts](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/master/packages/protocol/contracts) folder. Hopefully, you‚Äôve learned a few things about \_Getting started with the Celo CLI \_that you can apply in the real world.
