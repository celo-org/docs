## Hello Developers üå±

Welcome to today‚Äôs post, where we‚Äôll break down a blockchain topic into bite-sized pieces to help you learn and apply your new skills in the real world.

Today‚Äôs topic is _Plumo: An Ultralight Blockchain Client on Celo._

**Here‚Äôs a list of what we‚Äôll cover üóí**

- ‚úÖ Introduction to Plumo
- ‚úÖ Why is Plumo important?
- ‚úÖ A Simple Plumo Demonstration
- ‚úÖ Additional Plumo Resources

By the end of this post, you‚Äôll have a basic introduction to Plumo, tried a demo showcasing Plumo‚Äôs functionality, and have resources to help you learn more about Celo‚Äôs ultralight blockchain client.

Let‚Äôs go! üöÄ

## ‚úÖ Introduction to Plumo

Celo has announced the arrival of Plumo, Celo‚Äôs advanced ZK-snark-based light client protocol. Plumo, meaning feather in Esperanto, lives up to its name as an incredibly light client for the Celo blockchain.

Previously, Celo‚Äôs previous light client protocol was around 17,000 times lighter than Ethereum‚Äôs light client protocol. With Plumo, Celo is now 1.7 million times lighter.

_With Plumo, Celo is now 1.7 million times lighter than Ethereum!_

Anyone can now generate Plumo snark proofs that let dApps sync with the chain in a fully trustless manner. cLabs is hosting the first server that‚Äôs generating these proofs daily but anyone can run one of these.

Celo has also announced the launch of a WASM based library that lets web apps verify Plumo proofs, sync with the chain, and then verify state that‚Äôs happening as it‚Äôs fetched from full nodes on the network.

This means that for the first time in the crypto industry, applications will be able to connect to the P2P network, connect to the chain in a fully trustless manner, sync near instantly and verify state that they can request from any full node. All this is possible without having to have any trust assumptions, with those full nodes.

## ‚úÖ Why is Plumo important?

Syncing the latest state of a blockchain can be a resource-intensive task, driving users towards centralized services offering easier access. To expand decentralized services to anyone with a mobile phone, Celo created a consensus-agnostic compiler for constructing ultralight clients. This provides secure and highly efficient blockchain syncing via a sequence of SNARK-based state transition proofs with formally proven security.

_Plumo allows Celo nodes sync to the Celo blockchain faster with less data._

Devices can sync the latest network state summary in just a few seconds even on a low-end mobile phone. Using Plumo, each transition proof covers four months of blockchain history and can be produced for just \$25.

## ‚úÖ A Simple Plumo Demonstration

You can see Plumo in action [here](https://clever-cobbler-57426b.netlify.app/) using the Celo Wallet.

### Create New Account

Once on the site, either Create New Account or Use Existing Account if you would like to use your Celo account. Follow the instructions provided to get your account details, set your password, and login to your wallet.

Do you notice anything amazing? ü§î

Not yet?

Select the button that says Connected on the bottom right of your screen.

![image](images/3.png)

This will show you the Connection Status. Take note of the Last Block Number and close this window. Here it is **12946675**.

Wait a few seconds‚Ä¶ ü¶óü¶óü¶ó

Now select the Connected button again!

You should see that the Last Block Number is showing a newer block than it was before. In the image above the block is **12946680**‚Ä¶an entire 5 blocks have synced since last checked.

What you‚Äôre seeing is one of many possible examples of Plumo in action. It‚Äôs live syncing Celo network data to your device in real-time using an ultralight client. This could happen on a computer, a tablet, a phone, and even a cheap phone with low bandwidth-and before Plumo it could never happen so fast.

## ‚úÖ Additional Plumo Resources

A large amount of research, development, and innovation has gone into creating this light client, and there are many resources you can explore to learn more. Here are a few to help you get started.
