## Introduction


Celo is a mobile-first blockchain platform that has a goal to simplify access to global financial services. With its focus on mainstream adoption, Celo provides a user-friendly and accessible experience for people worldwide.


In this tutorial, we will explore the advanced features of the [Celo wallet](https://celowallet.app/), showing you how to navigate the platform with ease and take advantage of its full range of capabilities.


## Prerequisites


Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the Celo platform and its functionalities. You should also have a Celo wallet set up and ready to use.


To follow this tutorial, you should have some basic knowledge of how to use a Celo wallet and how to execute transactions on the Celo network. If you are new to Celo, we recommend checking out the official [Celo wallet guide](https://docs.celo.org/wallet) before proceeding.


You will also need to have a Celo wallet set up and funded with CELO and cUSD. If you don't have a wallet yet, you can create one easily on the Celo web wallet or using the Valora mobile app.


## Requirements

There are no specific technology requirements for this tutorial, but you should have access to a computer and a stable internet connection.


To follow this tutorial, you will need to have the following:

You will also need to have a Celo wallet with **CELO** and **cUSD** balances, as mentioned in the prerequisites section.

Now that you have all the necessary prerequisites in place, let's dive into some of the advanced features that the Celo wallet has to offer.


### 1. Exporting and Importing a Wallet


One of the most powerful features of the Celo wallet is the ability to export and import your wallet. This allows you to move your wallet between devices or back up your keys securely.


To export your wallet:


1. Open your Celo wallet and click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Select "Export Wallet" from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter your wallet password to confirm the export.
4. Save the exported file in a secure location, such as an encrypted USB drive or a password-protected folder.


To import your wallet:


1. Open your Celo wallet on the device you want to import your wallet into.
2. Click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Select "Import Wallet" from the dropdown menu.
4. Choose the exported file and enter your password to import your wallet.


### 2. Sending and Receiving Transactions


The Celo wallet allows you to send and receive transactions in a variety of currencies, including CELO, cUSD, and cEUR. To send a transaction, follow these steps:


1. Open your Celo wallet and navigate to the "Send" tab.
2. Enter the recipient's address and the amount you wish to send.
3. Select the currency you want to use for the transaction.
4. Review the transaction details and click "Send" to complete the transaction.


To receive a transaction, simply provide your Celo wallet address to the sender. They can then send the funds directly to your wallet.


### 3. Managing Multiple Accounts


The Celo wallet also allows you to manage multiple accounts, giving you greater flexibility and control over your funds. To create a new account, follow these steps:


1. Open your Celo wallet and navigate to the "Accounts" tab.
2. Click the "+" button to create a new account.
3. Choose a name for your account and select the currency you wish to use.

Another powerful feature of the Celo wallet is the ability to create and use multi-signature wallets. A multi-signature wallet requires multiple parties to sign a transaction before it can be executed, making it an excellent tool for organizations or teams.


Here's how to create a multi-signature wallet:


1. Open your Celo wallet and click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Select "Create Multi-Sig Wallet" from the dropdown menu.
3. Choose the number of required signatures for the wallet.
4. Enter the addresses of the other parties who will be signing transactions for this wallet.
5. Confirm the creation of the multi-signature wallet.


To use a multi-signature wallet, simply sign transactions as you would normally, but make sure that the required number of signatures are present before submitting the transaction.


### 5. Connecting to External DApps


This is yet another grand feature of the Celo wallet. The Celo wallet can also be used to connect to external decentralized applications (DApps) on the Celo network.


Here's how to do it:


1. Open your Celo wallet and click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Select "Connect to External DApps" from the dropdown menu.
3. Choose the DApp you want to connect to from the list of available options.
4. Follow the instructions provided by the DApp to connect your wallet and begin using the application.


### 6. Exploring the Celo Network and its Tools


Celo provides a range of tools and resources to help you explore the platform and its capabilities. Here are some useful resources to check out:


1. The Celo Explorer: This is a comprehensive tool that allows you to explore the Celo network, view transactions and blocks, and track network activity in real time.
