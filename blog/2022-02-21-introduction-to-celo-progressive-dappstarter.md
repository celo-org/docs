## Getting started

Welcome to the [Celo Progressive Dappstarter](https://celo-progressive-dapp-starter.netlify.app/)—a starter pack to get you up and running fast with Celo DApp development. The goal of this post is to get you up and running [Celo Progressive Dapp starter](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-progressive-dapp-starter) in about 15 minutes or less. From there you can quickly build, iterate, and deploy new DApps on the Celo blockchain.

**Here's a quick look at what you'll build**

:::info README

View the project [README](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-progressive-dapp-starter) for a quick summary of steps in this video.

:::

## Prerequisites

To start building, you’ll need a basic understanding of web development, Node (v12), yarn, and Git.

- Node (v12), [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Yarn
- Git

## Project stack

The Celo Progressive Dappstarter uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework with [Material UI](https://mui.com/), and [use-contractkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@celo-tools/use-contractkit) Celo library to get you started with building a responsive, web3 DApp quickly. The goal is to get you started quickly for ha reference and extend it with any web3 packages you are familiar with.

## Set up your project repo

Navigate to the [project repo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-progressive-dapp-starter) and select **Use this template**

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/2.png)

Add a repository **name**, **description **and click **Create repository from template.**

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/3.png)

:::info Include all branches

This template will soon include additional branches with new features. If you would like to include these branches in your repository, select **Include all branches**.

:::

## Create a local project

From your new GitHub repository, select code, and copy the GitHub URL for your project.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/4.png)

Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and `git clone` your project using the GitHub URL.

```
git clone https://github.com/path-to-your-project-repo
```

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/5.png)

Navigate into your Celo project and run `nvm use` to switch to a Celo compatible Node version. Celo is compatible with Node v12 as specified in `.nvmrc` of the project folder.

```
cd celo-progressive-dapp-starter
nvm use
```

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/6.png)

## Setup your testnet account

Create a new account and print the account number and private key using [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) `create-account`.

```
npx hardhat create-account
```

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/7.png)

Copy the testnet account address, paste it into the [Celo Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.celo.org) and select **Get Started** to transfer funds into your testnet account.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/8.png)

Import a new MetaMask account using your private key to view your newly funded Testnet Account.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/9.png)

:::info MetaMask Setup

Learn more about setting up your Alfajores Testnet with MetaMask [here](/wallet/metamask/setup#adding-a-celo-network-to-metamask)

:::

## Deploy smart contracts

Change into the hardhat directory and install the project dependencies.

```
cd packages/hardhat
yarn install
```

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/10.png)

Open your projects `.env` file and replace `PRIVATE_KEY` with the account **private key** from your terminal.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/11.png)

Return to your terminal and run `yarn deploy` to deploy your smart contracts.

:::info Redeploy contracts

You can run **yarn deploy --reset** to force re-deploy your contracts to any chain.

:::

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/12.png)

## Start the front-end

Navigate into the react-app directory and run `yarn install` to install the project front-end dependencies.

```
cd packages/react-app
yarn install
yarn dev
```

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/13.png)

Run `yarn dev` to start your development environment.

```
yarn dev
```

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/14.png)

Open [localhost:3000 ](http://localhost:3000/)to view your project.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/15.png)

## Explore your dApp

Enter a value in the **write contract **function and confirm the transaction to store a value.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/16.png)

Once the transaction has been complete (approximately 5 seconds) you may view the transaction using the alert that appears with a link to the [Celo Alfajores Block Explorer](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/).

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/17.png)

You should now be able to view the updated storage value using the **Read Storage Contract **function.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/18.png)

View the **Greeter Contract **using the tabs to interact with a similar contract that allows you to read and write string values rather than numbers.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/19.png)

## Customize your dApp

Smart contracts for this project are in the **packages/hardhat/contracts **folder.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/20.png)

The deploy scripts for each smart contract are found in** packages/hardhat/deploy/00-deploy.js**.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/21.png)

The front-end code for each smart contract interface are found in **packages/react-app/components **and are named as components that should be similar to the name of the smart contract.

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/22.png)

:::info Redeploy contracts

You can run **yarn deploy --reset** to force re-deploy your contracts to any chain.

:::

## View on Mobile

Serve your React app to your mobile device for testing via a tunnel. Next.js defaults to serving your app on `port 3000`.

```
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

:::info Local Tunnel

Read more about localtunnel [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel).

:::

![dappstarter](/img/doc-images/introduction-to-celo-progressive-dappstarter/23.png)

Your Celo dApp is now available on your mobile device at the URL provided in your terminal.
