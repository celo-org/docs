## Introduction

This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through setting up a crypto payment subscription platform on Celo. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working subscription platform and the knowledge to customize and expand it for your unique needs. This tutorial will be broken up into four parts; you must follow them in order as they build upon one another.

## Background Knowledge

In the web2 world, its common place to offer subscription services and allow your customer link a debit card so you can charge them periodically for the time of thier subscription. With the advert of stable curreny and merchant accepting them alongside exisiting payment method such as Paypal and card, thier needs to be full compatibilty of auto payment charge.

## Prerequisites

To start building, youâ€™ll need a basic understanding of web development, Node (v16), yarn, and Git.

- Your computer has Node.js installed. If not download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Familiar with React/Nextjs

## Requirements

For our project, we would be needing the following tools and framework

- Celo Composer React App - for UI
- Subgraph Packages - to index the data on the blockchain such that it's possible to query people's payments.
- OpenZeppelin Defender Admin
- Auto Task and Relayer

## Github Code

For your reference, you can use the completed tutorial [github code](https://github.com/alofeoluwafemi/crypto-subscription-payment-platform)

## Getting Started

To get started, we need to create our payment subscription Contract and UI with nextjs and tailwind CSS.

Install the celo composer to set up out development environment and create a new celo composer. On your terminal run these two commands;

```bash
npm i @celo/celocomposer -g
npx celo-composer-create
```

This will prompt you to select the framework and the template you want to use

After choosing the framework and the template, you'll be prompted to choose the smart contract development environment tool, decide whether or not to enable subgraph support, and give the project a name. Your terminal should seem like this at the end.

Open up your folder on your VS Code and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies, and `yarn run react:app dey` in your terminal to start our local environment. your web interface should look like this.

Next, we need to create the cards as seen on the Create a new file called **_PaymentCard.js_** in your component folder and add the following code inside

```js
import React from "react";

export default function PaymentCard({ planName, price }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col max-w-lg p-6 mx-auto text-center text-gray-900 bg-white border border-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow dark:border-gray-600 xl:p-8 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">

      <p className="font-light text-gray-500 sm:text-lg dark:text-gray-400">
        Best option for personal use &amp; for your next project.
      </p>
      <div className="flex items-baseline justify-center my-8">

      >
        Get started
      </a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

4 In your index.tx file , import your payment card, your final code should look like this.

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import PaymentCard from "../components/PaymentCard";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-8 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 sm:gap-6 xl:gap-10 lg:space-y-0">
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard planName={"Basic"} price={2} />
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard planName={"Premium"} price={5} />
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard planName={"Enterprise"} price={12} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Result below. However you can choose to add more cards to your own project and play around the styling, but for this tutorial we are just going to stick to three different payment plan

After this, click on your connect wallet button to see if it works, once it works its meant to show a disconnect button. However we also need to display the network its been connected to and the address of the wallet. So in your **_Header.tsx file,_** duplicate the button tag and add two more buttons to the header. Your final code should look like this

```js
import { Disclosure } from "@headlessui/react";
import { Bars3Icon, XMarkIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline";
import { useCelo } from "@celo/react-celo";
import Image from "next/image";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Header() {
  let [componentInitialized, setComponentInitialized] = useState(false);
  let { initialised, address, network, connect, disconnect } = useCelo();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialised) {
      setComponentInitialized(true);
    }
  }, [initialised]);

  return (

                    }
                  >
                    Connect
                  </button>
                )}
              </div>
            </div>

                Home
              </Disclosure.Button>
              {/* Add here your custom menu elements */}
            </div>
          </Disclosure.Panel>
        </>
      )}
    </Disclosure>
  );
}
```

Your output should look like below. You can see the Alfajores network and your wallet address after connecting your wallet.

However, the address button is way to long and doesn't look nice, we can make this better by truncating the address.

Add the following code below your imports and also call the truncate

```js
const truncateAddress = (address: string) => {
  return `${address.slice(0, 6)}...${address.slice(-4)}`;
};
```

Your final code should look like this

```js
import { Disclosure } from "@headlessui/react";
import { Bars3Icon, XMarkIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline";
import { useCelo } from "@celo/react-celo";
import Image from "next/image";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const truncateAddress = (address: string) => {
  return `${address.slice(0, 6)}...${address.slice(-4)}`;
};
export default function Header() {
  let [componentInitialized, setComponentInitialized] = useState(false);
  let { initialised, address, network, connect, disconnect } = useCelo();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialised) {
      setComponentInitialized(true);
    }
  }, [initialised]);

  return (

```

After this we would be writing our smart contract that interacts with our subscription, so head over to your terminal and run this command `yarn run hardhat:accounts` to view the account that is set up. You should get an error message stating you do not have any account setup, therefore we need a deployer wallet. To do this rename the file **\*env.example** to **.env** and add a test private key that has already been given by celo [here](https://celo-composer-community-docs.vercel.app/docs/frameworks/react-app/installation-and-setup) and copy the private key already given to us.

6 After this, re-run the above command and you should see an address in your terminal. Verify if the account as some celo in it via [celoscan](https://celoscan.io/) and if it doesn't you can request for a test token via [celo faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/). Head over to [open zepplin contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) and make use of the wizard shown below and copy the code generated into a new file created in the contract folder called **_MockCUSD.sol file_**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677729295502/cc133e24-48ea-402c-bced-7533fa27d873.png)

Let's install some OpenZeppelin contracts so we can get access to the ERC-721 contracts. In your terminal, execute the following command:

```bash
cd ..
cd hardhat
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts
```

- In the contracts folder, create a new Solidity file called **_PaymentSubscription.sol_**
- Now we would write some code in the **_PaymentSubscription.sol_**. We would be importing [Openzeppelin's ERC721 Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol).

Compile the contract, open up a terminal and execute these commands

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

If there are no errors, you are good to go ðŸ˜š

## Prefer Video

If you would rather learn from a video, we have a recording available of this tutorial on our YouTube. Watch the video by clicking on the screenshot below.

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEg1nRugl6E&list=PLOQEgpQdIoOTTc3F2OwsGk0r_n1KLkO0C)

Finally we have successfully completed our payment subscription UI and the contract and the next step is to write test for our smart contract which would be done in the next tutorial.

# Section 2

Congratulations on making it to this section! You've already read about smart contracts and UI using Nextjs and Tailwind in the first part of our tutorial. Now, we'll delve deeper into writing and verifying the smart contract by providing step-by-step instructions in this article.

# Prerequisites

To proceed, it's required that you finish the UI and smart contract [tutorial](https://hashnode.com/preview/631cd986f73f4734bc05524d), along with the associated unit tests. Further information on unit tests can be found [here.](https://www.guru99.com/unit-testing-guide.html)

# Step 1

Navigate into your test folder and create a new file called `subscription-test.js`

Head over to [Hardhat Network Helper](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/overview) which gives you the ability to mine blocks up to a certain timestamp or block number. To install paste the below command into your terminal

```bash
yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers
```

Once the initial task is completed, we must organize our test cases in a way that simplifies identifying what needs to be tested and the expected results. Below are the test cases we will use for this project:

- Do we have three plans?
- Is the first plan what we expect?
- Is the third plan what we expect?
- Is the second plan what we expect?
- Can we subscribe to the right plan?
- Can we subscribe to the wrong plan?
- Can we subscribe to the same plan twice?
- Can a user subscribe to a plan without enough allowance?
- Can a user be charged 11 more times after the first charge?
- Can a user subscribe to a plan without enough balance for the first charge?

To run the first step add the following code to your `subscription-test.js` file

```javascript
const { expect, assert } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const helpers = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");

const oneHour = 60 * 60 * 1;

before(async function () {
  const [deployer, accountA, accountB, accountC] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const MockCUSD = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockCUSD");
  const cUSD = await MockCUSD.deploy();
  await cUSD.deployed();

  const PaymentSubscription = await ethers.getContractFactory(
    "PaymentSubscription"
  );
  const paymentSubscription = await PaymentSubscription.deploy(cUSD.address);

  await paymentSubscription.deployed();

  this.paymentSubscription = paymentSubscription;
  this.cUSD = cUSD;
  this.deployer = deployer;
  this.accountA = accountA;
  this.accountB = accountB;
  this.accountC = accountC;
});

describe("PaymentSubscription", function () {
  it("Should have Basic plan", async function () {
    const basicPlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
    expect(basicPlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("2"));
    expect(basicPlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
  });
});
```

In your terminal, run this command:

```bash
 npx hardhat test test/subscription-test.js --network hardhat
```

You should see the following result in your terminal

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678051597384/08b925db-17d9-488f-8451-cf687253abd4.png)

Also, we need to try this for our premium plan and enterprise plan. In that same file add the following code

```javascript
it("Should have Premium plan", async function () {
  const premiumPlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(1);
  expect(premiumPlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("5"));
  expect(premiumPlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
});

it("Should have Enterprise plan", async function () {
  const enterprisePlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(2);
  expect(enterprisePlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("12"));
  expect(enterprisePlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
});
```

and run the same command in your terminal. Your terminal should look like this if properly executed.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678052443621/382c4bdc-925d-4d13-86c6-f182ef9dec59.png)

## Step 2

Also, we want a user to be able to subscribe to a 12-month plan. To do this, we need to add the following code after the enterprise plan function

```javascript
it("Should allow user to subscribe to a 12 months plan", async function () {
  const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
  await this.cUSD.approve(
    this.paymentSubscription.address,
    basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
  );
  await this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(basic.plan, 12);
  const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
    this.deployer.address
  );
});
```

Your final code should look like this.

```javascript
const { expect, assert } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const helpers = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");

const oneHour = 60 * 60 * 1;

before(async function () {
  const [deployer, accountA, accountB, accountC] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const MockCUSD = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockCUSD");
  const cUSD = await MockCUSD.deploy();
await cUSD.deployed();

  const PaymentSubscription = await ethers.getContractFactory(
    "PaymentSubscription"
  );
  const paymentSubscription = await PaymentSubscription.deploy(cUSD.address);

  await paymentSubscription.deployed();

  this.paymentSubscription = paymentSubscription;
  this.cUSD = cUSD;
  this.deployer = deployer;
  this.accountA = accountA;
  this.accountB = accountB;
  this.accountC = accountC;
});

describe("PaymentSubscription", function () {
  it("Should have Basic plan", async function () {
    const basicPlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
    expect(basicPlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("2"));
    expect(basicPlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
  });

it("Should allow user to subscribe to a 12 months plan", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
await this.cUSD.approve(
      this.paymentSubscription.address,
      basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
    );
await this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(basic.plan, 12);
const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
      this.deployer.address
    );
```

Run the same command in your terminal, and your terminal should give you the following output below:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678053462266/6df5b636-2b8c-4b90-b1c9-f95de8629095.png)

However, we need to confirm that the time a user subscribes is the actual current block time and that a user can subscribe to the wrong plan or the same plan twice. Paste the following code after the last function.

```javascript
const currentTime = (await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest")).timestamp;

    expect(subscription.plan).to.equal(basic.plan);
    expect(subscription.startDate).to.equal(ethers.BigNumber.from(currentTime));
    expect(subscription.endDate).to.equal(
      ethers.BigNumber.from(currentTime + 12 * oneHour)
    );
    expect(subscription.nextCharge).to.equal(
      ethers.BigNumber.from(currentTime + oneHour)
    );
  });

it("Should not allow user to subscribe to the wrong plan", async function () {
    await expect(this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(3, 12)).to.be.rejectedWith(
      Error
    );
  });

  it("Should not allow user to subscribe to the same plan twice", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await this.cUSD.approve(
      this.paymentSubscription.address,
      basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
    );

    expect(
      this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(basic.plan, 12)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Already subscribed");
  });
```

Run the same command in your terminal, and you should get the following results if executed correctly:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678058189074/27729e83-121f-489e-b256-9eeedf8541f8.png)

## Step 3

Finally, we would also test to see if a user could subscribe to a plan without enough allowance, be charged 11 more times after the first charge, and subscribe to a plan without enough balance for the first charge. Add the following code after your last test

```javascript
it("Should not allow user to subscribe to a plan without enough allowance", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await expect(
      this.paymentSubscription.connect(this.accountA).subscribe(basic.plan, 12)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Insufficient allowance");
  });

  it("Should not allow user to subscribe to a plan without enough balance for the first charge", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await this.cUSD
      .connect(this.accountA)
      .approve(
        this.paymentSubscription.address,
        basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
      );

    await expect(
      this.paymentSubscription.connect(this.accountA).subscribe(basic.plan, 12)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Insufficient balance");
  });

  it("Should allow user to be charged 11 more times after the first charge", async function () {
    await this.cUSD.mint(this.accountC.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("24"));

    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await this.cUSD
      .connect(this.accountC)
      .approve(
        this.paymentSubscription.address,
        basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
      );

    await this.paymentSubscription
      .connect(this.accountC)
      .subscribe(basic.plan, 12);

    for (let monthsCharged = 2; monthsCharged <= 12; monthsCharged++) {
      const currentBal = await this.cUSD.balanceOf(this.accountC.address);
      const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
        this.accountC.address
      );

      await helpers.time.increase(oneHour);

      console.table({
        monthsCharged,
        currentBal: ethers.utils.formatEther(currentBal),
        nextCharge: ethers.utils.formatEther(subscription.nextCharge),
      });

      await this.paymentSubscription
        .connect(this.deployer)
        .charge(this.accountC.address);
    }

    expect(await this.cUSD.balanceOf(this.accountC.address)).to.equal(0);

    const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
      this.accountC.address
    );
    const active = await this.paymentSubscription.activeSubscriptions(
      this.accountC.address
    );

    expect(subscription.nextCharge).to.equal(0);
    expect(active).to.equal(false);
  });
});
```

Run the same command in your terminal, and you should get the following results if executed correctly:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678096813584/c2a4dba3-8f44-45b6-b233-503fdd696089.png)

Awesome! We now have all our tests working, and the next thing we need to do is verify our contract and run a test coverage. To do this head over to [solidity coverage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-coverage) and run the command below in your terminal

```bash
yarn add solidity-coverage --dev
```

**Require** the plugin in `hardhat.config.js` by pasting this code

```javascript
require("solidity-coverage");
```

In your terminal run,

```bash
npx hardhat coverage --testfiles "test/registry/*.ts" --network hardhat
```

To verify your contract,

- Head over to [Celoscan](https://celoscan.io/)
- Login or Signup
- Click on the API-KEYs menu on the sidebar and generate a key
- Paste the key in the space available for it in the `.env` file

In your terminal run

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network alfajores
```

To deploy, open up `deploy.js` file in the deploy folder and paste the following code inside

```javascript
module.exports = async ({ getNamedAccounts, deployments }) => {
  const { deploy } = deployments;
  const { deployer } = await getNamedAccounts();

  const cUSD = await deploy("MockCUSD", {
    from: deployer,
    log: true,
  });

  console.log("cUSD deployed to:", cUSD.address);

  await deploy("PaymentSubscription", {
    from: deployer,
    args: [cUSD.address],
    log: true,
  });
};

module.exports.tags = ["MockCUSD"];
```

In your terminal, run

```bash
yarn run deploy
```

And to verify our contracts we need to use the format below.

```bash
npx hardhat verify <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS> --network alfajores
```

To verify our subscription payment smart contract that was deployed above, the command to run will be:

```bash
npx hardhat hardhat verify 0x95BD5b1B16C586025bF0750c21bd1de433de8D4c 0xEb3345B25d59Ad1dD153DAf883b377258E8515F9 --network alfajores
```

# Section 3

Congrats on reaching this section! You've learned about smart contracts, UI with Nextjs and Tailwind, testing, and contract verification in the past two tutorials. In this article, we will provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a subgraph that queries subscription details from the OpenZeplin Defender autotask script. This will help you better understand the process.

# Prerequisites

- [Create](https://thegraph.com/en/) an account on the subgraph
- Click on sign in with GitHub
- Install the graph globally on your local machine using npm. In your terminal run

In the project folder run:

```bash
yarn subgraphs:get-abi
```

## Step 1

To initialize the graph in our project, cd into the subgraph package folder and run

```bash
graph init
```

Choose Ethereum for protocol, and hosted services, and add your GitHub username as your subgraph name.

Add celo-alfajores as the network, and you should see the output below if executed successfully.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678226888850/597e9418-9fdf-423a-8650-79fd248ada45.png)

In our subgraph, a new folder called `ebook-payment-subscription-platform` has been created or in your own case whatever you named your folder name, Inside the folder, open the `schema.graphql` file and paste the following code inside.

```js
type Plan @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  plan: Int!
  price: BigInt!
  duration: BigInt!
  subscriptions: [SubscriptionP!]! @derivedFrom(field: "plan")
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  blockTimestamp: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}


type SubscriptionP @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  subscriber: Bytes! # address
  plan: Plan!
  nextCharge: BigInt!
  endDate: BigInt!
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  blockTimestamp: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}
```

Then in your subgraph.yaml file delete the default code and paste the following code

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.5
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum
    name: PaymentSubscription
    network: celo-alfajores
    source:
      address: "0x95BD5b1B16C586025bF0750c21bd1de433de8D4c"
      abi: PaymentSubscription
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.7
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Plan
        - SubscriptionP
      abis:
        - name: PaymentSubscription
          file: ./abis/PaymentSubscription.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: PlanCreated(uint8,uint256,uint256)
          handler: handlePlanCreated
        - event: SubscriptionCancelled(indexed address)
          handler: handleSubscriptionCancelled
        - event: SubscriptionCharged(indexed address,uint8,uint256)
          handler: handleSubscriptionCharged
        - event: SubscriptionCreated(indexed address,uint8)
          handler: handleSubscriptionCreated
      file: ./src/payment-subscription.ts
```

In your terminal run

```bash
graph codegen
```

You should see the following output

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678273533383/249cd13c-c2e4-4f9b-a134-ce23fb6e8baf.png)

Lets proceed to doing dome cleanups in our file , navigate to the src folder and open `paymentsubscription.ts` file, delete the default code and paste the following

```typescript
import { BigInt, Bytes } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";
import {
  PlanCreated as PlanCreatedEvent,
  SubscriptionCancelled as SubscriptionCancelledEvent,
  SubscriptionCharged as SubscriptionChargedEvent,
  SubscriptionCreated as SubscriptionCreatedEvent,
  PaymentSubscription as PaymentSubscriptionContract,
  PaymentSubscription__subscriptionsResult,
} from "../generated/PaymentSubscription/PaymentSubscription";
import { Plan, SubscriptionP as Subscription } from "../generated/schema";

export function handlePlanCreated(event: PlanCreatedEvent): void {
  let entity = new Plan(
    event.transaction.hash.concatI32(event.logIndex.toI32())
  );

  entity.plan = event.params.plan;
  entity.price = event.params.price;
  entity.duration = event.params.duration;

  entity.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  entity.blockTimestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  entity.save();
}

export function handleSubscriptionCancelled(
  event: SubscriptionCancelledEvent
): void {
  let entity = Subscription.load(event.params.subscriber);

  if (entity == null) {
    return;
  }

  entity.nextCharge = BigInt.fromI32(0);
  entity.endDate = BigInt.fromI32(0);

  entity.save();
}

export function handleSubscriptionCharged(
  event: SubscriptionChargedEvent
): void {
  let entity = Subscription.load(event.params.subscriber);

  if (entity == null) {
    entity = new Subscription(event.params.subscriber);

    let paymentSubscriptionContract = PaymentSubscriptionContract.bind(
      event.address
    );
    let subscription = paymentSubscriptionContract.subscriptions(
      event.params.subscriber
    );

    entity.plan = Bytes.fromI32(subscription.getPlan());
    entity.subscriber = event.params.subscriber;
    entity.endDate = subscription.getEndDate();
  }

  entity.nextCharge = event.params.nextCharge;

  entity.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  entity.blockTimestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  entity.save();
}

export function handleSubscriptionCreated(
  event: SubscriptionCreatedEvent
): void {
  let entity = new Subscription(event.params.subscriber);

  entity.subscriber = event.params.subscriber;

  let paymentSubscriptionContract = PaymentSubscriptionContract.bind(
    event.address
  );
  let subscription = paymentSubscriptionContract.subscriptions(
    event.params.subscriber
  );

  entity.plan = Bytes.fromI32(subscription.getPlan());
  entity.endDate = subscription.getEndDate();
  entity.nextCharge = subscription.getNextCharge();

  entity.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  entity.blockTimestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  entity.save();
}
```

## Step 2

The next action is to upload our subgraph , Head over to your dashboard and create a subgraph.

in your terminal run

```bash
graph auth --product hosted-service<the number generated for you>
graph deploy --product hosted-service<yourname-subgraphname>
```

You have successfully setup subgraph to query subscription details from openzepplin defender

# Final Section

# Introduction

Congrats on reaching this section! You've learned about smart contracts, UI with Nextjs and Tailwind, testing, a contract verification in the past three tutorials. In this article, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to Connect UI to Smart Contract & Setup Defender Admin, Replay & Autotask. This will help you better understand the process.

# Prerequisites

- [Create](https://thegraph.com/en/) an account on the subgraph
- Click on sign in with GitHub
- Install the graph globally on your local machine using npm. In your terminal run

## Step 1

To begin, paste the following code in your index.tx file

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import PaymentCard from "../components/PaymentCard";
import {
  abi as psAbi,
  address as psAddress,
} from "@ebook-payment-subscription-platform/hardhat/deployments/alfajores/PaymentSubscription.json";
import { useCelo } from "@celo/react-celo";
import { parseEther } from "ethers/lib/utils.js";

const plans = {
  0: { name: "Basic", price: 2 },
  1: { name: "Premium", price: 5 },
  2: { name: "Enterprise", price: 12 },
};

export default function Home() {
  const subscriptionToken = "0xEb3345B25d59Ad1dD153DAf883b377258E8515F9";
  const [activePlan, setActivePlan] = useState(null);
  const { kit, address } = useCelo();
  const paymentSubscriptionContract = new kit.connection.web3.eth.Contract(
    psAbi,
    psAddress
  );
  const cUsdContract = new kit.connection.web3.eth.Contract(
    [
      {
        inputs: [
          {
            internalType: "address",
            name: "spender",
            type: "address",
          },
          {
            internalType: "uint256",
            name: "amount",
            type: "uint256",
          },
        ],
        name: "approve",
        outputs: [
          {
            internalType: "bool",
            name: "",
            type: "bool",
          },
        ],
        stateMutability: "nonpayable",
        type: "function",
      },
    ],
    subscriptionToken
  );

  const subscribeToPlan = async (plan) => {
    try {
      const tx = await cUsdContract.methods
        .approve(
          psAddress,
          parseEther((plans[plan].price * 12).toString()).toHexString()
        )
        .send({ from: address });

      if (tx.status) {
        const tx = await paymentSubscriptionContract.methods
          .subscribe(plan, 12)
          .send({ from: address });

        if (tx.status) {
          setActivePlan(plan);
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const getActivePlan = async () => {
      const plan = await paymentSubscriptionContract.methods
        .subscriptions(address)
        .call();

      if (plan.endDate !== "0") {
        setActivePlan(parseInt(plan.plan));
      }
    };

    getActivePlan();
  }, [address]);

  return (
    <div className="space-y-8 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 sm:gap-6 xl:gap-10 lg:space-y-0">
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard
          planName={"Basic"}
          active={activePlan == 0}
          price={2}
          onClick={() => subscribeToPlan(0)}
        />
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard
          planName={"Premium"}
          active={activePlan == 1}
          price={5}
          onClick={() => subscribeToPlan(1)}
        />
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard
          planName={"Enterprise"}
          active={activePlan == 2}
          price={12}
          onClick={() => subscribeToPlan(2)}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Import the mock cUSD token we created with its contract address

To test the UI , in your terminal run

```bash
yarn run dev

```

and click on subscribe, your metamask should pop up and you should see the output below

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52764879/223791237-ab018d43-097a-4f82-8ebb-33f2bd34ea6d.png)

Sign the transaction and once succesfully executed, the subscribe button should change to unsubscribe.

Verify your contract on celoscan and you should see your transaction.

## Step 2

Head over to openzepplin, click on defender and sign up. Then click on add a contract

- name : EbookSPP
- network : celo alfajores
- address : "your contract address"

NOTE: it might throw an error saying "unable to fetch abi" , copy and paste the contract abi and click on create

## Step 3

Next we create a relay. A relay is like a private key that helps in creating a wallet that can be used like a relayer to interact with the smart contract. You can read more on relayer [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/relay).

To create a relayer follow these steps below:

- click on relayer on the side bar
- name : Ebook Relayer SPP
- network : Celo alfajores

then click on create.
send some celo to your relayer from your wallet.

## Step 4

Transfer the ownership of the contract to the relayer, I will strongly advice that you watch the video tutorial link that would be attached at the end of the article from this step because it is easier to graps and understand.

Make sure you go through the youtube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBOtaRCxBs) for the last part of the project.

Thank you for making it through from the first part to the final part.

## Conclusion

By now, you must have gotten the idea of how you can build automated payment subscription platform for charging your customer in crypto (CUSD). You have learn 4 major things; how to write test, how to deploy and query a subgraph, what a relayer is and finally how to automate things in a smart contract.
