## Introduction

The Web3 industry is rapidly expanding. Hundreds of decentralized networks, cryptocurrencies, and other blockchain-powered applications are anticipated to be launched on the internet and in the global finance industry in the future.

However, there's a need for more web3 developers to create and implement these projects to accelerate the development of the space further.

## Prerequisites​

This tutorial is designed for intermediate and beginner developers looking to port or start their amazing journey toward web3 development. Basic computer operation and programming knowledge in Python, JavaScript, and Solidity will help accelerate your journey even faster.

## Requirement

Ensure you install the necessary programming languages before starting on a PC or desktop. This makes learning easier and more convenient. In addition, ensure you download the necessary packages (which will not be fully explained) to ease learning.

## Getting started

According to [SlashData](https://www.developernation.net/developer-reports/dn22), a developer statistics organization, there were over 30 million software developers worldwide in the first quarter of 2022. Despite this enormous quantity, there are surprisingly few Web3 developers available.

There are still fewer than 20,000 Web3 developers working in the whole space. To put this in a better perspective, that's less than the number of developers working for Web2 brands like Meta alone. The number only accounts for less than 1% of developers worldwide.

With a small number of web developers and a growing market, the web3 sector desperately needs skilled programmers like YOU.

A roadmap for web3 developers provides step-by-step instructions on beginning a career as a Web3 developer. It is used by numerous institutions, training organizations, job seekers, and specialists in the web3 field. In this article, we'll go over the most crucial abilities required of web3 developers. We have also compiled a lengthy list of tools and ideas you should learn to get into the field.

## Understand the basics of several Web2 computer programming languages

Highlighted below are prerequisites beginners and intermediates should be aware of. They include a basic or in-depth knowledge of basic languages like [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), and more

Your Web2 knowledge will help you advance to Web3 and expose you to fundamental computer concepts (such as operating systems and networking) and problem-solving techniques necessary for web2 and web3 programming.

To fully understand the basic concept of programming, free resources and websites like [Celo Developer resources](https://docs.celo.org/developer), [Future Learn](https://www.futurelearn.com/subjects/it-and-computer-science-courses/coding-programming), and [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) provide the public with thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons.

## Learn the fundamentals of blockchain

![blockchain](./images/img1.jpg)

Although blockchain are brilliant technological innovation, blockchains can be difficult to comprehend. Blockchain is a distributed and public, ledger that keeps track of transactions, and asset. Blockchain as a technology might take some time and devotion to learning, but there are certain key aspects to keep an eye out for when starting out and they include:

The significance of blockchain

- Immutable records, smart contracts, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) are the three main components of the blockchain.
- Learn about the decentralization of Web3, consensus methods, hashing operations, mining, security, and cryptocurrencies.
- Include Web3 elements such as blocks, block indexes, timestamps, block hashes, block times, and others.

To understand blockchain technology better, there are free online courses from blockchain professionals. These include the free [Celo YouTube channel for developers](https://youtube.com/@CeloOrg), the Blockchain Developer Nano degree on Udacity, and the Blockchain Developer Course by Pluralsight.

## Learn cryptography

Cryptography is the most crucial and essential requirement for building a blockchain. Sensitive information can be safeguarded by cryptography from unauthorized access. The blockchain uses cryptographic methods as part of its security measures. Check out this comprehensive [list](https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography) (GitHub repository) of cryptography resources for a more in-depth understanding of encryption and the blockchain.

## Learn about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Celo, and any equivalent

Now, let’s take a closer look at blockchain architecture now. This [documentation](https://docs.celo.org/developer) helps you understand and build on Celo; for an interactive learning experience

## Understand smart contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run when certain conditions are satisfied on a blockchain. They are used to automate transaction performance so that everyone may know the outcome immediately without involving a third party or losing time.

You can create clients that communicate with the Ethereum Blockchain using Web3JS or build a full and lightweight framework for gaining access to the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem on the ethers.js library.

## Learn DApps (Web3 programming languages) – Solidity

Dapps stands for decentralized applications and describe the programs built on top of a blockchain. Dpps can be created as a website or mobile application since they are used in most functional ways like any other software program. There are tutorials and introductions to Dapps in several well-known ecosystems, some of which include:

- [Introduction to Dapps by Celo](https://docs.celo.org/showcase)
- [What Is a Decentralized Application?](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-application/?utm_source=remote3.co&utm_medium=remote3.co&utm_campaign=remote3.co)
- [Learn to Code Blockchain DApps By Building Simple Games](https://cryptozombies.io/)

The terms Web3 developer and "blockchain developer" are usually confused by newbies and people outside the community and are frequently interchangeably. While they both play a part in the web3 development, their jobs are distinct, and call for different skill sets.

As the name suggests, a Web3 developer develops blockchain-based applications. Web applications are made by Web3 developers using the design and protocol of Wweb3 architects. These programmers also oversee the stack dApps run on and develop their front-end and back-end.

Applications built using the blockchain architecture and protocol are the responsibility of blockchain software developers. They make smart contracts, which are blockchain-based programs that execute automatically when certain circumstances are satisfied. There are two categories of blockchain developers:

- Blockchain software developers
- Core blockchain developers are in charge of creating the blockchain system's architecture, design, and security.

## Web3 developer job description

Web3 developer job description entails the need for a job developer by the company, the expected duties you are to carry out, and the possible qualifications you are to have. In a web3 developer job description, some of the duties include

- The company's public API and SDK will be designed, implemented, and supported by Web3 developers.
- Requirements, wireframes, APIs, and SDK, should be designed, developed, supported, and maintained.
- Come up with and assess ideas for new tools and technology
- Help develop, test, and implement protocols
- Assume responsibility for the creation and upkeep of the interface that connects smart contracts with the native web experience.
- Make smart contracts for the issue, creation, and trading of financial instruments on the Ethereum-based blockchain.

## Are web3 developers in demand?

There is a high demand for web3 developers in the labor market. Companies and startups looking to create decentralized products for the public require highly skilled professionals in DApp language to bring these products to life.

## Why the Celo ecosystem is perfect for every developer

Celo is a layer one protocol and blockchain platform, and the Celo Mainnet is entirely separate from the Ethereum network. As both networks use the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to implement smart contract functionality, Celo and Ethereum are comparable in terms of programmability. Because of this resemblance, all programming languages, development tools, and standards geared toward the EVM apply to Celo and Ethereum.

With Celo, beginner Web3 developers can build for the 6 Billion smartphones on Earth. The ecosystem enables web3 developers to construct financial dApps that establish the foundations for everyone's success.

Every developer should use the Celo ecosystem because of its decentralized security. Because it is secure against hackers, it is prohibitively expensive for online criminals to hack a blockchain network.

Due to the Ethereum development ecosystem's maturity, many blockchain developers favor the Celo ecosystem. The ecosystem separates itself from the competition because of its wide variety of resources and development tools.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on being one of the many finishing the tutorial. Getting into web3 development might initially look difficult, but it is an excellent career choice, especially for beginners and intermediates with little or no experience.

If you choose to go self-paced (that is, self-teaching), ensure you understand basic programming, read up on the blockchain, and understand smart contracts, for better understanding.

You can also join the [Celo Developer community](https://celo.org/community), where you can connect with many like-minded people willing to help guide you toward taking the right step in your web3 development journey.
