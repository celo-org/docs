## Introduction

In the [part 1](https://docs.celo.org/blog/tutorials/how-to-write-a-multi-signatures-contract-on-celo-using-hardhat-part-1-2), we wrote a multi-signature smart contract in Solidity using Hardhat. Multi-signatures are a secure way to protect your cryptocurrency assets and the ownership of your smart contract. The multi-signature contract acts as a wallet, capable of executing transactions to transfer Ethereum or call other smart contracts.

In this part 2, we will write tests for our multi-signature contract using Hardhat. We will also deploy our contract on the Celo Alfajores testnet.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- A GitHub account [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Some knowledge of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org)
- Understanding of the multi-signatures concept (you can read more about it in [What Is a Multisig Wallet?](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-multisig-wallet/))
- Familiarity with the following multi-signature contract terms:

  - **Owners** - Addresses that can sign and execute transactions on this wallet contract.
  - **Threshold** - The number of owner signatures required for a transaction to be executed.
  - **Nonce** - A unique number that identifies each request to prevent signatures from being used on more than one transaction.

## Requirementsâ€‹

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- Node.js [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- VS Code [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- The Smart Contract Multi-Signature that we wrote in the [part 1](https://docs.celo.org/blog/tutorials/how-to-write-a-multi-signatures-contract-on-celo-using-hardhat-part-1-2) available on [GitHub](https://github.com/marc-aurele-besner/celo-multi-signatures-hardhat/tree/part-1-2)

## Setup our test helpers

To help us write our tests more efficiently, minimize code duplication, improve the maintainability of our repository, and make our tests more readable, we will create a few helper functions that we can reuse in our tests.

To do so, we will create a new folder called `helper` inside the `test` folder. Inside this folder, we will create a few files:

- `errors.js` - This file will contain all the error messages that we will use in our tests. (errors messages from the require statements in our contract)
- `utils.js` - This file will contain all the general purpose functions that we will use in our tests. (retrieve our wallets, deploy our contract, etc.)
- `signature.js` - This file will contain the functions that we will use to sign the transactions request before sending them to the contract.
- `test.js` - This file will contain the helper functions that we will use to call the contract functions and verify the results.
- `index.js` - This file will export all the functions from the other files.

To create the required directories and files, you can run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir test/helper
touch test/helper/errors.js test/helper/utils.js test/helper/signature.js test/helper/test.js test/helper/index.js
``` 

This should give you the following structure:

![Test Helper](./images/create_test_helper_files.png)

### Errors helper

In the `errors.js` file, we will add the following code:

```js
module.export = {
    NOT_SELF: 'CeloMultiSig: only this contract can call this function',
    MAX_OWNERS_COUNT_EXCEEDED: 'CeloMultiSig: cannot add owner above 2^16 - 1',
    INVALID_SIGNATURE: 'CeloMultiSig: invalid signatures',
    INVALID_OWNER: 'CeloMultiSig: invalid owner',
    OWNER_ALREADY_SIGNED: 'CeloMultiSig: owner already signed',
    NOT_ENOUGH_GAS: 'CeloMultiSig: not enough gas',
    OWNER_COUNT_BELOW_THRESHOLD: 'CeloMultiSig: cannot remove owner below threshold',
    THRESHOLD_IS_ZERO: 'CeloMultiSig: threshold must be greater than 0',
    THRESHOLD_GREATER_THAN_OWNERS_COUNT: 'CeloMultiSig: threshold must be less than or equal to owner count',
    OLD_OWNER_NOT_OWNER: 'CeloMultiSig: old owner must be an owner',
    NEW_OWNER_ALREADY_OWNER: 'CeloMultiSig: new owner must not be an owner',
    NEW_OWNER_IS_ZERO_ADDRESS: 'CeloMultiSig: new owner must not be the zero address',
}
```

These error messages are the same as the ones we used in our contract. We simply copy and paste them here and assign them to a variable. This has the advantage of making our tests more readable and easier to maintain, this way if we change the error message in our contract, we will only have to change it in one place.

This should give you the following result:

![Errors helper](./images/build_errors_helper.png)

### Utils helper

In the `utils.js` file, we will add the following code:

```js
module.export = {
}
```

### Signature helper

In the `signature.js` file, we will add the following code:

```js
const { network } = require('hardhat')

module.export = {
  signTransaction: async function (
    contractAddress,
    wallet,
    to,
    value,
    data,
    gas,
    nonce
  ) {
    const signature = await wallet._signTypedData(
      {
        name: 'CeloMultiSig',
        version: '1.0',
        chainId: network.config.chainId,
        verifyingContract: contractAddress,
      },
      {
        Transaction: [
          {
            name: 'to',
            type: 'address',
          },
          {
            name: 'value',
            type: 'uint256',
          },
          {
            name: 'data',
            type: 'bytes',
          },
          {
            name: 'gas',
            type: 'uint256',
          },
          {
            name: 'nonce',
            type: 'uint96',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        to,
        value,
        data,
        gas,
        nonce,
      }
    )
    return signature
  }
}
```

> **Note**
> This function use **_signTypedData** to sign the transaction as per ethersJS documentation [here](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-_signTypedData) but in future version of ethersJS, this function will be deprecated and replaced by **signTypedData**

Like this:

![Signature helper](./images/build_signature_helper.png)

### Test helper

In the `test.js` file, we will add the following code:

```js
module.export = {
}
```

### Exporting all the helpers

In the `index.js` file, we will add the following code:

```js
module.export = {
}
```
