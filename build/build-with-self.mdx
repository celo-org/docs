## What is Self?

[Self](https://self.xyz/) is a privacy-first, open-source identity protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs for secure identity verification.

It enables Sybil resistance and selective disclosure using real-world attestations like passports. With a few lines of code, developers can easily check if their users are humans, while preserving their privacy.

Access the [Self developer docs](https://docs.self.xyz/), explore APIs, and start building today.

## Verify Your Digital Identity

Seamlessly and securely verify your digital identity with Self. It allows you to:

- **Prove Your Humanity:** Confirm you are human without revealing personal information.
- **Proof your identity, age, nationality or :** Demonstrate where you're from while maintaining privacy. Securely capture the first page data and RFID from your passport to verify your identity.
