## What is the Jovian Hardfork?

The Jovian Hardfork adopts features from [Optimism's Jovian hardfork](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/superchain-upgrades.html) along with Celo-specific improvements focused on gas accounting and base fee alignment.

Key changes include:

- **Transfer Precompile Address Warming**: The transfer precompile now warms `from` and `to` addresses during execution, aligning with standard EVM behavior and ensuring correct gas accounting for subsequent operations on the same address.
- **Minimum Base Fee Transition**: Celo moves from its own gas price floor mechanism to Optimism's configurable Minimum Base Fee standard, maintaining a cost floor while aligning with OP Stack conventions.
For the full technical specification, see the [Jovian upgrade spec](https://specs.celo.org/upgrades/jovian.html).
- **L1 Fusaka Upgrade**: Celo now includes improvements to handle the L1 Fusaka upgrade, leading to better compatibility with the Optimism stack. For more details see [OP Fusaka upgrade notice](https://docs.optimism.io/notices/archive/fusaka-notice).

## For Node Operators

Software versions will be announced ahead of the activation date. Check back for updates.

<Tip>
**Docker Compose**

The required configuration for each service can be found in our [Docker Compose Setup](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-l2-node-docker-compose), where every network has a corresponding `<network>.env` file.
