This page outlines changes related to the Jello Upgrade for node operators.

<Note>
This page will be kept updated with key information about the upgrade. As this upgrade is activated via a smart contract switch, no concrete activation time can be given.

## What is the Jello Hardfork?

The Jello Hardfork enables OP Succinct Lite, a production-ready, zero-knowledge-powered fault proof system built in collaboration with OP Labs and Succinct.

Key benefits include:

- ZK-powered dispute resolution, reducing latency, cost and complexity in the dispute process
- Improved infrastructure security through bond-based incentives and proof verification
- Support for alternative DA layers, aligning with Celo’s modular roadmap

Succinct’s architecture is built on Optimism’s Kona execution engine, Succinct’s high-performance zkVM (SP1), and the Succinct Prover Network.

## For Node Operators

Node operators do **not** need to do any upgrades of the Celo client software for this Upgrade.

We recommend the latest released versions:

- `op-geth` at [v2.1.2](https://github.com/celo-org/op-geth/releases/tag/celo-v2.1.2)
- `op-node` at [v2.1.0](https://github.com/celo-org/optimism/releases/tag/celo-v2.1.0)
- `eigenda-proxy` at [v1.8.2](https://github.com/layr-labs/eigenda/pkgs/container/eigenda-proxy/437919973?tag=v1.8.2)

<Tip>
**Docker Compose**

The required configuration for each service can be found in our [Docker Compose Setup](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-l2-node-docker-compose), where every network has a corresponding `<network>.env` file.
