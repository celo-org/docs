## Mainnet

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My node is having trouble keeping up to date with the chain head / having trouble connecting to and finding peers">

A couple of issues could be causing this.

* If you are running multiple instances of op-node, make sure to check that they each have a unique and persisted private key at `--p2p.priv.path`
* Ensure that your node is accessible to other nodes, check the __Configure P2P for external network access__ section under [Running a full node](/infra-partners/operators/run-node#running-a-full-node)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I run a node or upgrade an existing node?">

See the guides for [running a node](/infra-partners/operators/run-node) or the guide on [how to migrate an L1 node](/infra-partners/operators/migrate-node).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to run my own EigenDA proxy?">

Yes. This is part of [running a node](/infra-partners/operators/run-node).
If you're using the [Docker Compose Setup](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-l2-node-docker-compose), it's included.
