## 🚀 What is SocialConnect?

SocialConnect is an open-source protocol that maps off-chain personal identifiers (such as phone numbers, Twitter handles, etc.) to on-chain account addresses. This enables a convenient and interoperable user experience for various use cases, including:

- **Payments**: Send money directly to your friend's phone number.
- **Social Discovery**: Find someone's account based on their Twitter handle or other identity applications.

For a short demo of a payment from a Kaala wallet user to a Libera wallet user using only a phone number, check out the [SocialConnect documentation](https://socialconnect-docs.vercel.app/).
