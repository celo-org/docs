## Building DApps for MiniPay Wallet

---

Welcome to the MiniPay wallet integration guide. [MiniPay](https://www.opera.com/products/minipay) is one of the fastest growing wallets that was built out by Opera on Celo that seeks to create a simple user experience to use DApps. MiniPay is available inside Opera Mini browser on Android phones thereby allowing DApp developers to tap into a distribution of 100M users on integration. This guide will help you build DApps for MiniPay.

:::info
[Install](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.minipay) the new MiniPay standalone app now! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ“¥
:::

### Get Started with Building on MiniPay

#### 1. Create your MiniPay dApp using Celo Composer and selecting the MiniPay template (less than 5 mins).

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create -t minipay
```

#### 2. Get Testnet tokens from [faucet.celo.org](https://faucet.celo.org/)

#### 3. Installing MiniPay

:::info
MiniPay is only available on Celo and Celo Testnet. MiniPay is not available to be used on other chains.
:::

MiniPay is available inside Opera Mini and in a [standalone App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.minipay), so far only on **Android**. MiniPay comes per default only ready to go in Opera Mini in countries, where it is live, meaning in countries where on- and off-ramping is provided. To ensure that your DApp functions as expected within the MiniPay environment, it's crucial to test it inside the MiniPay app. Here's how you can set up and test your DApp:

- **Install the [MiniPay standalone app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.minipay):** Start by downloading the MiniPay standalone application from the PlayStore on your Android phone.[Download MiniPay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.minipay)
- **Create an Account:** Before you can test your DApp, you need to create an account on the MiniPay app. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account using your Google account and your phone number.

#### 4. Test your DApp inside MiniPay

1. Open the MiniPay app on your phone and go to settings.

  style={{ width: 250 }}
  alt="Open MiniPay dApp store"
/>

2. Navigate into the "About" section and enable the developer mode by clicking "Version" number until you see a message pop up that you have enabled developer mode.

  style={{ width: 250 }}
  alt="Open MiniPay dApp test page"
/>

3. When you go back into settings you should now see the option for "Developer Settings".

  style={{ width: 250 }}

4. To enable the Celo testnet, Alfajores L2, you need to toggle "Use test net".

5. Navigate into the "Developer Settings", enable the "Developer Mode" and click "Load Test Page". A popup to enter a URL should apprear.

  style={{ width: 250 }}
  alt="MiniPay dApp testing"
/>

6. Enter the URL of your DApp and click on "Go". You should now get redirected to the site tester.

#### 5. Testing Local Development with MiniPay

If you're developing your DApp locally (e.g., on `localhost:3000` using Next.js or a similar framework), you can use `ngrok` to tunnel the traffic over HTTP. This allows you to test the localhost version in real-time inside MiniPay.

- **Install ngrok:** If you haven't already, install ngrok. You can find instructions on their [official website](https://ngrok.com/download).
- **Start Your Local Server:** Ensure your local development server is running. For instance, if you're using Next.js, you might run `npm run dev` to start your server at `localhost:3000`.
- **Tunnel Traffic with ngrok:** In your terminal, run the following command to start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

This will provide you with a public URL that tunnels to your localhost.

- **Test in MiniPay:** Copy the provided ngrok URL and use it inside the MiniPay app to test your DApp.

### Get your dApp ready for MiniPay

:::warning
MiniPay uses Custom Fee Abstraction based transactions, which is not yet supported by Ethers.js.
:::

#### 1. Viem

Viem is another library gaining traction. Here's how you can integrate it:

```js
import { createWalletClient, custom } from "viem";
import { celo, celoAlfajores } from "viem/chains";

const client = createWalletClient({
  chain: celo,
  // chain: celoAlfajores, // For Celo Testnet
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
});

const [address] = await client.getAddresses();
```

#### 2. Wagmi

Wagmi.js is an emerging library in the Ethereum ecosystem. To integrate it with MiniPay's provider, you can use the `useConnect` hook:

```js
import { useConnect } from "wagmi";
import { InjectedConnector } from "wagmi/connectors/injected";

const { connect } = useConnect({
  connector: new InjectedConnector(),
});

useEffect(() => {
  connect();
}, []);
```

This code sets up an `InjectedConnector` and then utilizes the `connect` method from the `useConnect` hook. The `useEffect` ensures that the connection is established when the page loads.

In the Viem example, we're creating a wallet client that specifies the chain and a custom transport using `window.ethereum`. The `getAddresses` method then retrieves the connected addresses.

### Important Notes

- Ensure the "Connect Wallet" button is hidden when your DApp is loaded inside the MiniPay app, as the wallet connection is implicit.

_Code Example to hide Connect Wallet button if the user is using MiniPay wallet_

```jsx
export default function Header() {
  // State variable that determines whether to hide the button or not.
  const [hideConnectBtn, setHideConnectBtn] = useState(false);
  const { connect } = useConnect();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (window.ethereum && window.ethereum.isMiniPay) {
      // User is using MiniPay so hide connect wallet button.
      setHideConnectBtn(true);

      connect({ connector: injected({ target: "metaMask" }) });
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="absolute inset-y-0 right-0 flex items-center pr-2 sm:static sm:inset-auto sm:ml-6 sm:pr-0">
      {/* Conditional rendering of Connect Wallet button */}
      {!hideConnectBtn && (
        <ConnectButton
          showBalance={{
            smallScreen: true,
            largeScreen: false,
          }}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Always verify the existence of `window.provider` before initializing your web3 library to ensure seamless compatibility with the MiniPay wallet.
- When using `ngrok`, remember that the tunneling URL is temporary. You'll get a new URL every time you restart ngrok.
- Be cautious about exposing sensitive information or functionality when using public tunneling services like ngrok. Always use them in a controlled environment.
- MiniPay currently supports setting the `feeCurrency` property when running `eth_sendTransaction`. However, currency support is limited to `cUSD`. More currencies might be supported in future.
- MiniPay only accepts legacy transactions at the moment. EIP-1559 properties won't be considered when handling requests.
