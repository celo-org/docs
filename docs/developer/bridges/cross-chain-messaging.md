Cross-Chain Messaging enables seamless communication and data transfer between different blockchain networks, allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to interact and share information across multiple ecosystems.

:::warning
As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo is no longer a standalone Layer 1 blockchainâ€”it is now an Ethereum Layer 2!
Some documentation may be outdated as updates are in progress. If you encounter issues, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/issues/new/choose).

## Chainlink CCIP

[Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://chain.link/cross-chain) is a decentralized messaging protocol designed to enable secure and seamless communication between different blockchain networks. Built on Chainlink's proven oracle infrastructure, CCIP allows smart contracts to send and receive messages, data, and tokens across chains, facilitating cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi), interoperability, and multi-chain application development.

### Supported chains

- [Celo Mainnet](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/celo-mainnet)
- [Celo Alfajores](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/testnet/chain/celo-testnet-alfajores)

## Wormhole

[Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) is a decentralized cross-chain messaging protocol that enables the transfer of assets and data between different blockchain networks. It acts as a universal interoperability layer, allowing tokens, NFTs, and smart contract messages to move seamlessly across chains. Wormhole uses a network of decentralized guardians (validators) to securely verify and relay messages between blockchains.

### Supported chains

- Celo Mainnet
- Celo Alfajores

## Layer Zero

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) is an omnichain interoperability protocol designed to enable seamless communication and asset transfers between different blockchain networks. It uses a lightweight messaging layer to connect blockchains, allowing smart contracts to send and receive data and tokens across chains without relying on intermediaries. LayerZero emphasizes security, efficiency, and decentralization.

### Supported chains

- Celo Mainnet

## Axelar Network

[Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/) is a decentralized cross-chain communication platform that enables seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks. It provides a universal messaging protocol and decentralized gateway for transferring assets and data across chains. Axelar uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and a network of validators to securely route messages and enable cross-chain smart contract calls.

### Supported chains

- Celo Mainnet
- Celo Alfajores
