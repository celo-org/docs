# Web3Modal SDK

The [Web3Modal SDK](https://web3modal.com/) is a framework agnostic library that allows you to easily connect your Web3 app with wallets.
It provides a simple and intuitive interface for apps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.

:::warning
As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo is no longer a standalone Layer 1 blockchainâ€”it is now an Ethereum Layer 2!
Some documentation may be outdated as updates are in progress. If you encounter issues, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/issues/new/choose).

For the most up-to-date information, refer to our [Celo L2 documentation](https://docs.celo.org/cel2).
