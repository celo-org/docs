# Oracles on Celo

This page lists Oracles running on the Celo network.

Oracles are essential components in blockchain ecosystems, acting as bridges that connect on-chain smart contracts with real-world data. They allow smart contracts to access information that exists outside the blockchain, such as financial market data, weather conditions, or other off-chain events. This capability is crucial because blockchains, by design, cannot access external data directly due to their isolated nature.

Here are lists of all on-chain Oracles:
