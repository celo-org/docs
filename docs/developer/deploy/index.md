How to build and deploy a dApp with Celo.

## Using Celo Composer

[Celo Composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer) allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, examples, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp.

```jsx
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create
```

## Using EVM Tools

<!-- make the below text code block because crowdin is messing it up -->

```mdx-code-block
Developers can build with Celo using many [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) compatible tools including Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, and others. By making a few adjustments to your project’s network configuration settings, you can deploy your new or existing dApp on Celo.
