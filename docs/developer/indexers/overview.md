## Data Indexer

Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when you’re building a dapp. For example the [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graph’s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.
