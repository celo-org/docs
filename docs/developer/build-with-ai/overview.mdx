## Introduction {#introduction}

Welcome to the world of AI Agents. This guide provides an overview of AI agents, the tools and infrastructure needed to build them, and examples of successful implementations. Whether you're starting with basic automation or aiming to create complex autonomous systems, this guide will help you understand the ecosystem.

## What is an AI Agent? {#what-is-an-ai-agent}

AI Agents are software systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. As Shaw (creator of Eliza/ai16z) describes them, they're like "a new kind of website" that provides an interface to interact with APIs, potentially offering better solutions for complex tasks than traditional graphical interfaces.

Key characteristics:
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Environment perception and interaction
- Decision-making capabilities
- Ability to learn and adapt (in advanced implementations)

You probably are aware of social agents or trading agents. These can reach different levels of complexity. When you deploy your first agent it will probably be one, that has the most basic functionalities. Then you can start adding more complex tasks, e.g., to evolve the agent into a more autonomous form. Learn more about the different types of agents.

## Types of AI Agents {#types-of-ai-agents}

### 1. Basic AI Agents
- Chat interfaces with basic decision trees
- Command processors
- Simple input/output automation

### 2. Functional Agents
Specialized agents with clear boundaries:
- Code review agents
- Research assistants
- Domain-specific problem solvers
- Tool-augmented agents

### 3. Autonomous Agents
Independent operators with minimal human intervention:
- Task automation systems
- Self-improving agents
- Multi-step reasoning agents
- Goal-setting and planning systems

### 4. Multi-Agent Systems
Collaborative systems featuring:
- Collective problem-solving
- Distributed decision-making
- Agent-to-agent communication

The interesting part about agents will be the framework you are using for them to interact with each other. You have frameworks, that provide a decentralized voting infrastructure, where different agents, have different amounts of voting power and have to convince each other about decisions. Then you have agents, that have a more simple setup but can hire other agents for specific tasks. 
Please refer to this [table](https://www.aiagenttoolkit.xyz/) for a consecutive list of all frameworks, tools and infrastructure.

## Building Blocks {#building-blocks}

### Frameworks {#frameworks}

**On Celo:**
- [**Olas**](https://docs.autonolas.network/open-autonomy/): Framework for autonomous economic agents in decentralized markets - Tutorial coming soon!
- [**Gaia**](https://www.gaianet.ai/): Building intelligent ecosystems for evolving AI applications - Tutorial coming soon!

**Other Frameworks:**
- [**ElizaOS**](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/): TypeScript-based framework with multi-agent simulation capabilities - To build on Celo use the [EVM plugin](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/plugin-evm) - Tutorial coming soon!
- [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com/): Framework for LLM-powered applications
- [**MetaGPT**](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT): Multi-agent meta programming framework, like a software company with product managers / architects / project managers / engineers.

### Launchpads {#launchpads}

No-code solutions for quick deployment, below two examples for launchpads for social agents with a token:
- [**Virtuals**](https://app.virtuals.io/): No-code AI Launchpad with LLP context system
- [**Vapor**](https://alpha.vaporware.fun/): Platform built on ai16z Eliza Framework

### Essential Tools {#essential-tools}

There are a multitude of tools including blockchain integration, machine learning, data, memory, simulation development, monitoring, security, hardware integration, and standardization. Please refer to this table for a comprehensive list of all currently available tools. When building an autonomous agent, the most crucial parts for a quick start will be:

- Blockchain tools to act on-chain
- Memory tools, so your agent can learn and improve
- Access to the right LLMs that are specialized in Web3 data

If you are planning to build out your agent, you will also have to think about important features to add or consider:

- Platforms/Frameworks to launch multi-agent economies
- Access rights for your agent in your local environment
- Prompt verification and control
- Providing your agent with functionalities to chat with videos, PDFs, and research papers
- Understanding the difference between LLMs, NLP, and RAG Tools and how to use them for your project
- Automation

Below we will provide some examples and explain concepts more in detail:

## Intelligence Tools {#intelligence-tools}

### Machine Learning Tools {#machine-learning-tools}

- **Examples**: LiteLLM, ModelZoo, TensorServe, GPT-Explorer
- **Use Cases**: Pattern recognition, classification, prediction

### Natural Language Processing Tools {#natural-language-processing}
- **Purpose**: Language understanding and processing
- **Examples**: NeuralSpace, LangFlow

### Security and Policy {#security-and-policy}
- **Functor Network**: Policy framework for autonomous agents

### Data {#data}

When working with AI Agents, you'll need to understand how to train your own models and how to scrape and collect the right data for your needs. When creating a unique character, you'll need substantial data for model training. One effective approach is to have multiple agents interact with each other to generate synthetic data for your models. The next consideration is how to license this data as intellectual property.
- [DataSphere](https://github.com/datasphere/datasphere): Vidualization tool tht offers insights into large-scale datasets for exploratory data analysis.
- [JinAI's LLM-friendly Markdown Tool](https://github.com/jina-ai/serve): This tool crawls any website to convert it into a format that is friendly for LLMs. It simplifies the process of preparing web data for Al analysis by providing an LLM-friendly markdown version.
