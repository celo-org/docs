# Build with DeFi

In this guide you can explore tooling and infrastructure for building DeFi on Celo. 

## Overview  

Stablecoins play a crucial role in decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing price stability, reducing volatility, and enabling seamless financial transactions. Celo has built an ecosystem optimized for stablecoins, making it a leading platform for real-world DeFi applications. With a focus on financial inclusion, building on Celo means enabling accessible and affordable financial tools for people around the world.  

## Why Stablecoins Matter  

Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to a stable reserve, such as fiat currency or a basket of assets. They provide key benefits in DeFi and financial transactions and financial inclusion:  

- **Price Stability** – Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins maintain a predictable value.  
- **Low-Cost Transactions** – Sending stablecoins on Celo costs significantly less than on traditional blockchains.  
- **Borderless Access** – Users can send and receive stablecoins globally, without needing a bank account.  
- **Programmability** – Stablecoins can be used in smart contracts to enable lending, savings, and remittances.  
- **Financial Inclusion** – Stablecoins empower unbanked and underbanked populations with access to digital financial services.
