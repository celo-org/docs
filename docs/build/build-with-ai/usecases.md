## What You Can Build

#### Onchain Foreign Exchange (FX) Trading with Autonomous Agents
- Celo, known as the "Home of Stablecoins," supports several dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and 13 native stablecoins tracking currencies such as the US Dollar, Euro, Brazilian Real, and Kenyan Shilling.
- Build AI agents that facilitate seamless onchain FX trading, leveraging Celo's native stable assets and incentivized liquidity pairs on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/celo) (powered by [Merkl campaigns](https://merkl.angle.money/?chain=42220) and managed through Steer Protocol).
- **Arbitrage Bots**
    - Develop AI-driven arbitrage bots that identify and execute profitable trades across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Celo, optimizing for low fees and fast transaction times.
- **Liquidity Pool (LP) Management**
    - Create AI tools to automate LP management, ensuring optimal allocation of assets, rebalancing, and yield maximization.
- **Merkle Rewards Optimization with Steer Protocol**
    - Find the Merkl campaigns with the highest rewards and provide liquidity through Steer Protocol.

#### Prediction Markets
- Design AI-powered prediction markets that leverage Celo's stablecoins for low-cost, high-efficiency betting and forecasting.

#### Automated Savings and Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)
- Develop AI agents that help users automate savings strategies or execute DCA plans using Celo's stablecoins, making financial planning effortless.

#### Automated Data Collection Payments
- Today, 82.7% of collected biodiversity data comes from North America and Europe, leaving massive data gaps in emerging markets.
- AI agents can automate payments for individuals and communities in Celo’s ecosystem, ensuring fair, real-time compensation for valuable data collection.
    - See a [case study](https://www.daviddao.org/posts/regenerative-intelligence/) on how GainForest is using AI to drive regenerative finance and intelligent data economies.

#### Optimized Retroactive Funding
- The Celo ecosystem has hosted multiple retroactive funding rounds to reward top contributors for their impact. 
- AI agents can automate and optimize this process by analyzing onchain activity, GitHub contributions, and deployed contracts to fairly distribute funding.
    - Check out [Proof-of-Ship](https://github.com/celo-org/Proof-of-Ship) for a list of projects deployed on Celo this month.
    - Check out [EasyRetroPGF](https://easyretropgf.xyz/celo-citizen-retro/stats) for a list of all contributors who received retroactive funding on Celo last month.
