title: One-Click Quickstart
---

Create and deploy Web3 apps effortlessly with Thirdweb and Celo. 

---

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

* Be able to transfer Celo to another address
* Have a mintable **NFT Drop**.

## Prerequisites

* Node (v20 or higher)
* A wallet with some test tokens (more on this later)

## Fund Your Wallet  

1. Ensure you have sufficient funds to cover the transaction fees.  
2. Visit the [Alfajores Faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores) to claim test tokens using a wallet address. ***Remember to claim only what you need.***

## Create a Contract on Thirdweb

1. Visit [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/login) and log in or create a new account.  
2. Navigate to **`Contracts`** and click **`Deploy Contract`**.  
3. Since multiple smart contracts have already been audited, there's no need to write them from scratch.  
4. Select **`NFT Drop`** and click **`Deploy`**.  
5. Configure the token by setting its **Name** (mandatory), **Symbol**, and optionally adding an **Image** and **Description**.  
6. In the **Deploy Options** section, choose **`Celo Alfajores`** as the Chain (if not selected by default).  
7. Click **`Deploy Now`** to finalize the process.  
8. After deployment, well’ll be redirected to the dashboard to upload your NFTs.  
9. Provide a **name**, upload an **image**, add a **description**, and define **traits** for the NFT.  
10. **Lazy Mint** the NFT.  
11. Copy the **`contract address`** from the NFT dashboard.  

## Make the NFT Mintable

1. On the dashboard, go to **Claim Conditions**
2. Click on **Add Phase**.
2. Specify the **Default Price (0.1)** and the **Limit per wallet (3)**.
3. Click on **Save Phases**.

## Get a Thirdweb Client ID  

1. Open the **Thirdweb Dashboard** and click **`Add New`** in the **Projects** section.  
2. Select **`Project`** from the dropdown menu.  
3. Enter a **project name** and add **`localhost:5173`** under **`Allowed Domains`**. Click **`Create`**.  
4. A **`Client ID`** and **`Secret ID`** will be generated. Copy both to a secure location—we’ll only need the **`Client ID`**.  

## Clone the Thirdweb Celo NFT Repository  

1. Clone the repository: 
 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/celo-org/one-click-quickstart
   cd one-click-quickstart
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:


	```sh
	npm install
	```
	
3. Create a .env file with the following content:


	```sh
	VITE_CLIENTID=your_thirdweb_client_id
	VITE_ADDRESS=your_nft_contract_address
	VITE_ADRESS_TO=your_wallet_address
	```	
	
4. Run the project:


	```sh
   npm run dev
	```
	
Once the project is running, there will be two links, the first named **Send Celo** and the second named **Mint NFT**. 
The first one will be displayed by default. Click on the **Connect** button to connect the wallet. Enter an 
address and an amount of Celo to transfer. The second link will display an NFT along with its description and by pressing
the mint button, 0.1 Celo will be paid.
