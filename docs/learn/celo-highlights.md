# Highlights

Summary of features and metrics driving the Celo platform.

## Features

### Stable Value Currencies 

Celo includes native support for multiple [ERC20-like stable currencies](learn/celo-protocol.md#stable-cryptocurrencies) pegged to ‘fiat’ currencies like the US dollar, to facilitate the use of Celo as a means of payment.

### Accounts Linked to Phone Numbers 

Celo maintains a secure [decentralized mapping of phone numbers](../celo-codebase/protocol/identity) that allow wallet users to send and receive payments with their existing contacts simply and with confidence that the payment will reach the intended recipient.

### Transaction Fees in Any Currency 

Users can [pay transaction fees](../celo-codebase/protocol/transactions/erc20-transaction-fees) in stable currencies so that they do not need to manage the balances of different currencies.

### Immediate Syncing Even on Slow Connections

Extremely fast, secure [synchronization](../celo-codebase/protocol/plumo) between mobile devices and the Celo network means that even wallet users with high latency, low bandwidth, or high-cost data tariffs can use Celo. Celo removes the need to check every header before a received header can be trusted. The performance will be further improved with BLS signature aggregation and succinct zero-knowledge proofs, via zk-SNARKs.

### Proof-of-Stake

Celo uses a [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](../celo-codebase/protocol/proof-of-stake) consensus algorithm. In comparison to Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this eliminates the negative environmental impact and means that users can make transactions that are cheaper, faster, and where the outcome cannot be changed once complete.

### On-chain Governance 

Since great user experiences and operating a modern networking protocol need iteration and improvement, Celo supports rapid upgrades and protocol changes via on-chain governance in which all CELO holders can participate.

### Programmable (Full EVM Compatibility 

Celo includes a programmable smart contract platform that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is already widely adopted, familiar to developers and has strong tool support. This enables Celo to deliver rich user features and rapidly support a wide ecosystem of third-party applications and extensions.

### Self Custody 

Users have access to and fully control their funds and account keys, and don't need to depend on third parties to make payments.
## Metrics

### Validators

110 Globally

Celo has a validator set with a current size of 110 validators. Validators are elected to this set on a daily basis; typically more validators stand for election than seats available. The validator set size may be raised in the future through the [on-chain governance](../celo-codebase/protocol/governance) process.

You can view more detailed infor about the current validator set at [stats.celo.org](https://stats.celo.org/).
