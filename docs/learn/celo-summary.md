## EVM-Compatible

An EVM-compatible solution capable of reaching billions of global users at scale, Celo’s technology supports 1000+ projects from builders, developers, and even artists who everyday launch new applications and issue digital currencies from everywhere in the world usable by anyone in the world with a desktop computer or mobile phone.
