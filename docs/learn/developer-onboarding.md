# Developer Onboarding

Start your journey toward developing decentralized applications on the Celo platform. 

___

## What to expect

These resources help you learn about the Celo mission, platform architecture, and how you can stay connected with our community. You’ll also be introduced to our developer ecosystem and make use of our tools and resources to build and deploy your first decentralized application on the Celo platform.

## Prerequisite knowledge

In order to be successful, we recommend having experience developing with Web 2.0 technologies along with a basic understanding of Bitcoin, Ethereum, decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain technologies.

If you’re unfamiliar with any of these topics, here’s a few places to get started:
