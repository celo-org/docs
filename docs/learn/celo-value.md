# Celo Value

### **Stable Value Currencies** 

Celo includes native support for multiple ERC20-like stable currencies pegged to ‘fiat’ currencies like the US dollar, to facilitate the use of Celo as a means of payment.

### **Accounts Linked to Phone Numbers** 

Celo maintains a secure decentralized mapping of phone numbers that allow wallet users to send and receive payments with their existing contacts simply and with confidence that the payment will reach the intended recipient.

### **Transaction Fees in Any Currency** 

Users can pay transaction fees in stable currencies so that they do not need to manage the balances of different currencies.

### **Immediate Syncing Even on Slow Connections** 

Extremely fast, secure synchronization between mobile devices and the Celo network means that even wallet users with high latency, low bandwidth, or high-cost data tariffs can use Celo. Celo removes the need to check every header before a received header can be trusted. The performance will be further improved with BLS signature aggregation and succinct zero-knowledge proofs, via zk-SNARKs.

### **Proof-of-Stake** 

Celo uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. In comparison to Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this eliminates the negative environmental impact and means that users can make transactions that are cheaper, faster, and where the outcome cannot be changed once complete.

### **Full Node Incentives** 

The Celo protocol offers incentives for running full nodes to service the light clients that run on each mobile device. Unlike other Proof-of-Stake systems, users can still earn cryptocurrency in exchange for providing compute resources without having to stake funds.

### **On-chain Governance** 

Since great user experiences need constant iteration, Celo supports rapid upgrades and protocol changes via on-chain governance in which all cryptocurrency holders can participate.

### **Programmable (Full EVM Compatibility)** 

Celo includes a programmable smart contract platform that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is already widely adopted, familiar to developers and has strong tool support. This enables Celo to deliver rich user features and rapidly support a wide ecosystem of third-party applications and extensions.

### **Self Custody** 

Users have access to and fully control their funds and account keys, and don't need to depend on third parties to make payments.
