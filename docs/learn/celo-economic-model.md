# Celo's Economic model

## **Sacred Economics**

Celo’s philosophy is grounded in the work of Charles Eisenstein’s[ Sacred Economics](http://sacred-economics.com/film/).

## **Theory Of Change**

A theory of change is a framework that describes how short-term actions will lead to long-term social impact. Celo’s aim is to create the conditions for prosperity, defined as people fulfilling basic needs, growing along their own unique paths, and supporting each other. All of Celo’s projects have a specific hypothesis that ties our activities to one or more of these indicators of prosperity.
