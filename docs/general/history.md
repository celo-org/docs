## The Evolution of Celo: From Layer 1 to Layer 2

This timeline highlights the key milestones in Celo's development, from its launch as a Layer 1 blockchain to its exploration of becoming an Ethereum Layer 2 solution.

## Timeline of Celo's Journey:

#### July 2015: Ethereum Launch

Ethereum debuts as a Proof-of-Work blockchain, introducing smart contracts but facing high fees and energy consumption.

#### April 2020: [Celo Mainnet Launch](https://blog.celo.org/its-official-celo-mainnet-is-here-6a3a71763f68)

Celo officially launches its mainnet on Earth Day, marking its debut as a Layer 1 blockchain network. Designed with a focus on energy efficiency and low transaction costs, Celo sets out to provide a more sustainable and accessible blockchain solution.

#### May 2021: [Celo Donut Hard Fork](https://blog.celo.org/donut-hardfork-is-live-on-celo-585e2e294dcb)

The Donut hard fork is implemented on Celo, enhancing its EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility and introducing cross-chain interoperability with other blockchain networks.

#### September 2022: [Ethereum Proof of Stake Transition](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/)

Ethereum completes its transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, significantly reducing its energy consumption and addressing some of the sustainability concerns that Celo originally set out to solve.

#### January 2023: [Celo 2.0 Announcement](https://forum.celo.org/t/the-next-chapter-introducing-celo-2-0/5124)

cLabs announces Celo 2.0 with improved Ethereum compatibility, better performance, and enhanced tokenomics.

#### July 2023: [Layer 2 Transition Proposal](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109)

In a strategic move, cLabs proposes transitioning Celo from an independent Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2 to leverage Ethereum's security and expand its reach within the Ethereum ecosystem.

#### September 2023: [Gingerbread Hard Fork Proposal](https://forum.celo.org/t/introducing-celo-s-gingerbread-hard-fork-join-for-q-a-on-june-21/5918)

The Gingerbread hardfork is implemented to prepare for Celo L2 with a focus on improving Celo's compatibility with Ethereum by streamlining code and introducing <ColoredText>[Ultragreen Money](https://blog.celo.org/ultragreen-money-c677e7508abb)</ColoredText>, on-chain carbon offsetting through transaction fees, enhancing both performance and sustainability.

#### April 2024: [Celo joins Optimism OP Stack](https://x.com/Celo/status/1782394244352860589)

cLabs <ColoredText>[proposed the OP Stack](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposes-migrating-celo-to-an-ethereum-l2-leveraging-the-op-stack/7902)</ColoredText> for its Layer 2 migration to align more closely with Ethereum, reduce production time, enhance security, and maintain its unique features with minimal migration risk.
