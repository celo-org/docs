:::

Until March 26, 2025 at block height 31,056,500, Celo L1 has been a mobile-friendly blockchain focused on financial inclusion. It enables fast, low-cost transactions, supports stablecoins like cUSD, and uses phone numbers for payments. Built on proof-of-stake, it’s carbon-neutral and powers a growing DeFi ecosystem.

The journey continues with the [migration to L2](/docs/cel2)!
