title: Getting CELO for Gas Fees
---

When using a [Celo-optimized wallet](./wallets.md), gas fees can be paid with various ERC-20 tokens including ETH, USDC, USDT, cUSD and CELO. For non Celo-optimized wallets, you’ll need CELO tokens for gas fees.

::warning
As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo is no longer a standalone Layer 1 blockchain—it is now an Ethereum Layer 2!
Some documentation may be outdated as updates are in progress. If you encounter issues, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/issues/new/choose).
