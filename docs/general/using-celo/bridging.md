title: Bridging
---

Bridging allows users to transfer assets between the Celo network and other blockchain networks. This section provides an overview of available bridging and swapping options.

:::warning
As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo is no longer a standalone Layer 1 blockchainâ€”it is now an Ethereum Layer 2!
Some documentation may be outdated as updates are in progress. If you encounter issues, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/issues/new/choose).

For the most up-to-date information, refer to our [Celo L2 documentation](https://docs.celo.org/cel2).

Be sure you understand and review the risks when bridging assets between chains.
