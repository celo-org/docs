# Celo Wallets

On this page you will find an overview of digital wallets available to send, spend, and earn Celo assets.

## Choosing a Wallet

Wallets are tools that create accounts, manage keys, and help users transact on the Celo network.

:::warning
It's important to be careful when choosing a wallet because they manage your secret account keys. You should only use reputable wallets that are well-maintained by organizations/people that you trust. We added links to the source code so you can see when it's been last updated.

The [Celo Native Wallets](#celo-native-wallets) section shows some popular wallets that were built specifically for the Celo network. They often include features that more general wallets do not, like paying for fees with ERC20 tokens, like cUSD. The [Celo Compatible Wallets](#celo-compatible-wallets) section has wallets that can work with Celo but were built for other networks (like Ethereum) or through company partnerships (like Pesabase).
