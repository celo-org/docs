# Transactions

Introduction to Celo transactions and gas prices.

:::warning
As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo is no longer a standalone Layer 1 blockchainâ€”it is now an Ethereum Layer 2!
Some documentation may be outdated as updates are in progress. If you encounter issues, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/issues/new/choose).

For the most up-to-date information, refer to our [Celo L2 documentation](https://docs.celo.org/cel2).

## Celo vs Ethereum Transactions

Transactions in the Celo protocol include payments, contract calls, and other operation which modifies state. They are similar to Ethereum transaction with the following key differences.

- Gas prices must meet or exceed the [gas price minimum](/protocol/transaction/gas-pricing).
- Gas fees may be paid in currencies other than the native CELO.
