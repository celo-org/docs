## Celo vs Ethereum Transactions

Transactions in the Celo protocol include payments, contract calls, and other operation which modifies state. They are similar to Ethereum transaction with the following key differences.

- Gas prices must meet or exceed the [gas price minimum](/protocol/transaction/gas-pricing).
- Gas fees may be paid in currencies other than the native CELO.
