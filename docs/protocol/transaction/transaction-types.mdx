## Summary

Celo has support for all Ethereum transaction types (i.e. "100% Ethereum compatibility")
and a single Celo transaction type.

## Background

### Legacy transactions

Ethereum originally had one format for transactions (now called "legacy transactions").
A legacy transaction contains the following transaction parameters:
`nonce`, `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `recipient`, `amount`, `data`, and `chaindId`.

To produce a valid "legacy transaction":

1.  the **transaction parameters** are [RLP-encoded](https://eth.wiki/fundamentals/rlp):

    ```
    RLP([nonce, gasprice, gaslimit, recipient, amount, data, chaindId, 0, 0])
    ```

1.  the RLP-encoded transaction is hashed (using Keccak256).

1.  the hash is signed with a private key using the ECDSA algorithm, which generates the `v`, `r`,
    and `s` **signature parameters**.

1.  the transaction _and_ signature parameters above are RLP-encoded to produce a valid **signed
    transaction**:

    ```
    RLP([nonce, gasprice, gaslimit, recipient, amount, data, v, r, s])
    ```

A valid signed transaction can then be submitted on-chain, and its raw parameters can be
parsed by RLP-decoding the transaction.

### Typed transactions

Over time, the Ethereum community has sought to add new types of transactions
such as dynamic fee transactions
([EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559))
or optional access list transactions
([EIP-2930: Optional access lists](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930))
to supported new desired behaviors on the network.

To allow new transactions to be supported without breaking support with the
legacy transaction format, the concept of **typed transactions** was proposed in
[EIP-2718: Typed Transaction Envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718), which introduces
a new high-level transaction format that is used to implement all future transaction types.

### Distinguishing between legacy and typed transactions

Whereas a valid "legacy transaction" is simply an RLP-encoded list of
**transaction parameters**, a valid "typed transactions" is an arbitrary byte array
prepended with a **transaction type**, where:

- a **transaction type**, is a number between 0 (`0x00`) and 127 (`0x7f`) representing
  the type of the transaction, and

- a **transaction payload**, is arbitrary byte data that encodes raw transaction parameters
  in compliance with the specified transaction type.

To distinguish between legacy transactions and typed transactions at the client level,
the EIP designers observed that the **first byte** of a legacy transaction would never be in the range
`[0, 0x7f]` (or `[0, 127]`), and instead always be in the range `[0xc0, 0xfe]` (or `[192, 254]`).

With that observation, transactions can be decoded with the following heuristic:

- read the first byte of a transaction
- if it's bigger than `0x7f` (`127`), then it's a **legacy transaction**. To decode it, you
  must read _all_ bytes (including the first byte just read) and interpret them as a
  legacy transaction.
- else, if it's smaller or equal to `0x7f` (`127`), then it's a **typed transaction**. To decode
  it you must read the _remaining_ bytes (excluding the first byte just read) and interpret them
  according to the specified transaction type.

Every transaction type is defined in an EIP, which specifies how to _encode_ as well as _decode_
transaction payloads. This means that a typed transaction can only be interpreted with knowledge of
its transaction type and a relevant decoder.
