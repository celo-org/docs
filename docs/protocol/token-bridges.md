description: Token bridges enable cross-chain asset transfers between blockchains.
---

A token bridge is a protocol that enables the transfer of cryptocurrency tokens between different blockchain networks by creating wrapped versions of tokens that maintain their original value while being compatible with the destination blockchain.
