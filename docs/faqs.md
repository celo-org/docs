## Technical Questions

### How is Celo Secured?

Celo uses proof-of-stake to maintain security and has a complex election process to determine validators of its blockchain. Holders of CELO are able to use their holdings as a means of participating in elections by voting for groups of validators.

### Regarding Celo Blockchain, do we have another source for on-chain data apart from [explorer.celo.org](https://explorer.celo.org/)?

[https://www.thecelo.com/](https://www.thecelo.com/) is an alternative source for on-chain data.

### How does Celo handle Governance?

All CELO owners can participate in on-chain governance which votes on Celo Governance Proposals (visible here [https://celo.stake.id/#/](https://celo.stake.id/#/) ). One of the first governance proposals was to [re-name Celo Gold (cGLD) to CELO](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-to-rename-celo-gold-to-celo-native-asset/528) (Coinbase still hasn’t been renamed to CELO so you’ll see it listed at cGLD there)

The (DAO of) CELO owners also govern the [Community fund](https://celocommunityfund.org/). [25% (governable parameter) ](./celo-codebase/protocol/proof-of-stake/epoch-rewards/community-fund)of the minted block rewards go to this fund. The community can decide how to spend it. It’s also worth noting, that 0.1% of block rewards go to a carbon offset fund, currently, those go-to project [Wren](https://www.wren.co/profile/celo) for planting trees.

Can I access DeFi DApps using Valora?

The Valora team just spun out of cLabs and their CEO is currently reviewing their product strategy. Originally Valora was designed as a Venmo payments app based on user research in emerging markets

For DeFi - today the easiest experience is to visit a dApp’s website and either use Valora on mobile or Metamask chrome plugin on desktop (advanced users only)

## DeFi (Lending, pooling, liquidity mining, farming)

### What are liquidity provision and farming?

Pools are a way to provide liquidity, or the ability to trade, between two different tokens. They allow you to get exposure to the price of two tokens while earning trading fees on your tokens.

Staking tokens in a pool gives you a token called a liquidity provider token (or LP token for short). These LP tokens are extremely useful, as they can be used to provide loan collateral, earn rewards in a yield farming platform, and many other use cases.

### How can I provide liquidity and farm tokens of Celo’s ecosystem?

[Ubeswap](https://ubeswap.org/) (more info [here](https://docs.ubeswap.org/tutorial/providing-liquidity))and [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) offer liquidity provision and farming functionalities on Celo.

### What about borrowing, lending, and interest-earning on Celo?

[Moola](https://moola.market/) is a non-custodial liquidity protocol built on the Celo blockchain that is democratizing access to yield and credit. Depositors earn passive yield which is paid for by borrowers who are able to take over-collateralized loans in perpetuity or under-collateralized flash loans. Moola has shared ancestry with Aave v1.

### Are there risks associated with using Celo’s DeFi platforms?

As with any new technology, not all risks can be eliminated. Some of them are smart contract risk (unknown vulnerability with the code) and liquidation risks.
