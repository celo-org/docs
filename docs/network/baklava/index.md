:::

The **Baklava Testnet** is Celo’s dedicated testnet for node operators, offering a dynamic environment to test node upgrades, infrastructure, and new protocol releases before they are deployed to Mainnet. Participants can use Baklava to simulate Mainnet processes, identify vulnerabilities in upcoming software, and experiment with infrastructure changes in a risk-free setting.

Comprehensive network details are available [in the network overview](/network#celo-baklava-testnet).

:::warning

The Baklava Testnet is designed for testing and experimentation by developers. Its tokens hold no real world economic value. The testnet software will be upgraded on a regular basis. You may encounter bugs and limitations with the software and documentation.
