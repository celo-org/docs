# Cannoli Testnet

Collection of resources to get started with Celo Cannoli Testnet (Celo's Ultragreen Testnet).

---

## What is the Cannoli Testnet?

For Earth Day 2023, the Celo Community has proposed a new [Ultragreen CIP](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0052.md), which strives to position Celo to become deflationary as well as further Celo's sustainability commitment . With each transaction, [CIP-52](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0052.md) proposes that 80% of the base fee would be burned and 20% would be sent to a Carbon Offset address to purchase high-quality carbon offsets. This testnet is intended to support this new ‘Ultragreen’ mechanism before this change is later proposed for a future hardfork.
