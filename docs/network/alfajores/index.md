:::

The **Alfajores Testnet** is Celo’s primary public developer testnet, providing a stable environment for developers to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications before launching on Mainnet. Developers can access testnet funds via the [faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores), interact with smart contracts, and experiment with wallets, dApps, and node operations without financial risk.

The full network information is available [in the network overview](/network#celo-alfajores-testnet).

:::warning

The Alfajores Testnet is designed for testing and experimentation by developers. Its tokens hold no real world economic value. The testnet software will be upgraded on a regular basis. You may encounter bugs and limitations with the software and documentation.
