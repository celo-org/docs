# Nodes and Services

Connect to nodes and services in the Celo Ecosystem.

:::warning
Celo is currently transitioning from a standalone Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2. As a result, certain information about developer resources may be outdated.

For the latest information, please refer to our [Celo L2 documentation](https://docs.celo.org/cel2).

### Forno

[Forno](/network/node/forno) is a cLabs hosted node service for interacting with the Celo network. This allows you to connect to the Celo Blockchain without having to run your own node.

Forno has HTTP and WebSocket endpoints that you can use to query current Celo data or post transactions that you would like to broadcast to the network. The service runs full nodes in non-archive mode, so you can query the current state of the blockchain, but cannot access the historic state.

Forno can be used as an HTTP Provider with ContractKit.
