# Networks

Overview of Celo Mainnet, Alfajores Testnet, and Baklava Testnet.

---

## Celo Mainnet

The production Celo network, Mainnet was previously known as the Release Candidate 1 network. Deployed by the Celo community starting 4/22/20, the network is currently working towards enabling the Celo stability mechansim. Much of the activity is being driven by the validator organisations that featured on the leaderboard of [The Great Celo Stake Off](https://forum.celo.org/t/the-great-celo-stake-off-the-details/136).

**Chain ID:** `42220`

## Alfajores, the Developer Testnet

If you're a developer considering building on the Celo platform, or want to try out the [Celo Wallet](https://celo.org/build/wallet), start with [Alfajores](/getting-started/alfajores-testnet). You can [obtain a balance](https://celo.org/build/faucet) immediately and use it for experimenting with. The [SDK tutorials](/developer-guide/start) assume you are using Alfajores. The network is managed by cLabs, who operate all of its validators, and its software and deployed contracts will track mainnet.

## Baklava, the Node Operator Testnet

If you're interested in operating one or more nodes that make up Celo's infrastructure, start with [Baklava](/getting-started/baklava-testnet). Baklava's validators and full nodes are operated by the community. It is intended to provide a venue to test new builds of the Celo Blockchain software, trial on-chain governance proposals, and for node operators to build operational best practices. Support for developers and users of the Wallet is not the primary focus.

The Baklava Testnet is a non-production Testnet for the Validator community.

**It serves several purposes:**

- **Operational excellence**: Build familiarity with the processes used on Mainnet, and to verify the security and stability of your infrastructure with the new software.
- **Detecting vulnerabilities**: Discover bugs in new software releases before they reach Mainnet.
- **Testing ground**: Experiment with new infrastructure configurations in a low-risk environment.

:::warning

The Baklava Testnet is designed for testing and experimentation by developers. Its tokens hold no real world economic value. The testnet software will be upgraded and the entirety of its data reset on a regular basis. This will erase your accounts, their balance and your transaction history. The testnet software will be upgraded on a regular basis. You may encounter bugs and limitations with the software and documentation.
