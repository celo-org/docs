# Using a Ledger with MetaMask

Things to keep in mind when using a Ledger hardware wallet with MetaMask to connect to the Celo network.

___

## Using the Ledger

* When using MetaMask with a Ledger, users should open the Ethereum app on their Ledger hardware device, not the Celo app. 
* Users using a Celo-specific wallet with the Ledger should still use the Celo app.

## Recovering Assets

* When recovering [Celo sent to an Eth address](celo-holder-guide/eth-recovery.md), use Metamask with the Ethereum app on the Ledger device.
* When recovering [Eth sent to a Celo address](celo-holder-guide/celo-recovery.md), use the Celo app on the Ledger device with any Celo wallet.
