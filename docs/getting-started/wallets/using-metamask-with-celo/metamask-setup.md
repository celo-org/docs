## Introduction to MetaMask

MetaMask is a crypto wallet that allows you to buy, store, send and swap tokens. Celo enables MetaMask users to connect with Celo and interact with all of the dApps available on the Celo network.

## MetaMask integrates with Celo

Celo users are able to integrate with MetaMask, the world's most popular non-custodial digital wallet and Web3 gateway for desktop and mobile. Millions of users worldwide use MetaMask to safely discover, store and send digital assets, securely interact with third-party sites without exposing unnecessary data, and source the best prices across the widest variety of digital tokens.

## Why use MetaMask with Celo?

MetaMask is a blockchain-based application that equips you with a key vault, secure login, token wallet and token exchange. It provides a secure means to connect to blockchain-based applications. MetaMask was originally created to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, has a large and growing community of users, and provides both an in-browser extension and a mobile app. Using MetaMask with Celo makes it quick and easy to access the Celo dApps with this powerful crypto wallet.

## A quick note before getting started

Celo works with MetaMask, but MetaMask does not actively support compatibility with Celo. For that reason, it's important to note that a few things might not work perfectly. For example, the MetaMask UI might show the ETH logo or currency symbol where you might expect it to show the Celo logo or currency symbol, or it might show no logo at all.
