### Baklava Testnet

The [Baklava Testnet](/getting-started/baklava-testnet) is focused on building operational experience and best practices for node operators.

It is designed for validators and testing protocol changes. You will most likely not develop on the Baklava testnet. If you have an idea for a project that uses more protocol features in terms of handling the community fund or uniquely handling epoch rewards, like block rewards or staking rewards, it might be useful to develop on Baklava.

- [Baklava Faucet Request Form](https://forms.gle/JTYkMAJWTAUQp1sv9) - to request faucetted funds to become a Validator on the Baklava network.
- [Baklava Network Status](https://baklava-celostats.celo-testnet.org/) - to check the current availability of the testnet
- [Baklava Network Block Explorer](https://baklava-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/) - explore the history of the blockchain and view transaction details
