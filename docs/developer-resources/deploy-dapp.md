# Build on Celo

How to set up your development environment and deploy on Celo.

___

The fastest way to build and deploy on Celo is to [Set up a Testnet Development Wallet](./testnet-wallet.md) and [Deploy with Remix](./deploy-remix.md).  This doesn’t require installing anything on your local device and gives you access to powerful web-based tools for dApp development. Alternatively, you can set up a local development environment and deploy using many popular dApp deployment tools.

:::tip

Developers can build on Celo using any [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) compatible tools including Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, and others. By making a few adjustments to your project’s network configuration settings, you can deploy your new or existing dApp on Celo.
