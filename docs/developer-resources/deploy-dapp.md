Deploying a dApp on Celo is a quick and simple process. You can deploy on Celo using any [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) compatible tools including Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, and others. By making a few adjustments to your project’s network configuration settings, you can deploy your new or existing dApp on Celo.

## Start Building on Celo

The fastest way to deploy a dApp on Celo is to [Set up a Testnet Development Wallet](./testnet-wallet.md) and [Deploy with Remix](TODO).  This doesn’t require installing anything on your local device and gives you access to powerful web-based tools for dApp development. Alternatively, you can set up a local development environment and deploy using many popular dApp deployment tools.

## Set up your local environment

- [Using Mac](./using-mac.md)
- [Using Windows](TODO)

## Set up a development wallet

- [Set up a Testnet Development Wallet](TODO)
