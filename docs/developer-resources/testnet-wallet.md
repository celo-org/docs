# Testnet Development Wallet Setup

While developing and deploying dApps on Celo, itâ€™s helpful to have a wallet prepared with funds to pay for any transactions you make on the blockchain. These can be set up using either real or test funds, and this allows application developers and users to interact Celo applications more easily.

:::note

This guide will focus on funding an account on MetaMask with Celo ([Alfajores testnet](/getting-started/alfajores-testnet) tokens). You can also use the [Celo Extension Wallet](/getting-started/wallets#celoextensionwallet) if you prefer. Additionally, you can fund your wallet with real Celo if you would like to deploy to the Celo mainnet.

## Step 1: Download a Wallet

When deploying a dApp, you will need to pay for transactions that write data to the Celo blockchain. This is done using a wallet funded with Celo on your preferred network.

- Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for your browser
- If using MetaMask, [Connect MetaMask to Celo](/getting-started/wallets/using-metamask-with-celo) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLHeCb01fzs)) to access Celo network options from your wallet
