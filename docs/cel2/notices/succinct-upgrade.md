## What is the Succinct Upgrade?

As part of [Celo’s continued growth as an Ethereum L2](https://forum.celo.org/t/celo-as-an-ethereum-l2-a-frontier-chain-for-global-impact/11376), Celo is integrating OP Succinct Lite, a production-ready, zero-knowledge-powered fault proof system built in collaboration with OP Labs and Succinct. The upgrade adds ZK-powered fault proofs, used only in the event of a dispute on chain,m which is designed to improve finality, reduce complexity, and strengthen security.

Key benefits include:

- Faster and configurable finality, with proofs generated only when disputes occur
- ZK-powered resolution, reducing latency and complexity in the dispute process
- Improved infrastructure security through bond-based incentives and proof verification
- Support for alternative DA layers, aligning with Celo’s modular roadmap

Succinct’s architecture is built on Optimism’s Kona execution engine, Succinct’s high-performance zkVM (SP1), and the Succinct Prover Network.
