The instructions for migrating a Celo node from Layer 1 to Layer 2 are outlined [in this guide](/cel2/operators/migrate-node). This process is necessary to transition your Celo L1 node to the new Celo L2 architecture based on the OP-Stack.

If you wish to run a Celo L2 node from scratch, you can follow the instructions in the [Running a Celo Node](/cel2/operators/run-node) guide.
