# Preparing for the L2 migration

:::info

Node operators should review this page along with [Migrating a Celo L1 Node](../operators/migrate-node.md) and [Running a Celo Node](../operators/run-node.md).

The two main steps to prepare for the hardfork are

1. Upgrading L1 nodes
2. Running a pre-migration (Or choosing to use `snap` sync to start your L2 node, in which case no migrations are needed. See [Running a Celo Node](../operators/run-node.md).)

## Upgrade L1 nodes

Prior to the L2 hardfork, all node operators must upgrade their existing L1 (`celo-blockchain`) nodes to version [v1.8.9](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/releases/tag/v1.8.9). This release defines hardfork block numbers such that nodes will stop producing or accepting blocks immediately before the hardfork.

## Run a pre-migration

Note that you may choose to start an L2 node from scratch using `snap` sync, in which case you don't need to run any data migrations. See [Running a Celo Node](../operators/run-node.md) for more information.

Node operators who plan to migrate their pre-hardfork data to an L2 node are strongly encouraged to run a pre-migration ~1-2 days before the hardfork. This will migrate the majority of data and minimize downtime during the full migration. To learn more about the migration process and tooling, see [Migrating a Celo L1 Node](../operators/migrate-node.md).

:::warning
**Migrating archive data is not recommended.**

Both the pre-migration and full migration must be run on full node data. If you only have Celo archive nodes, we recommend syncing a full node in preparation for the L2 hardfork. You should not migrate archive data even if you plan to run an L2 archive node. See [Running an archive node](../operators/run-node.md#running-an-archive-node) for more information.
:::

We recommend running the migration script (which includes commands for both the pre-migration and full migration) using [celo-l2-node-docker-compose](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-l2-node-docker-compose). If necessary, the script can also be run from source.

### Run pre-migration with docker

1. Stop your node.
2. Pull the latest version of [celo-l2-node-docker-compose](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-l2-node-docker-compose) and `cd` into the root of the project.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/celo-org/celo-l2-node-docker-compose.git
    cd celo-l2-node-docker-compose
    ```

3. Run pre-migration command, where `<network>` is one of `alfajores`, `baklava`, or `mainnet`.

    :::warning
    Please ensure your node is stopped before running the migration tool.
    :::

    ```bash
    ./migrate pre <network> <path-to-your-L1-datadir> [<L2_destination_datadir>]
    ```

    If a destination datadir is specified, ensure the value of `DATADIR_PATH` inside `.env` is updated to match when you start your node.

### Run pre-migration from source

If you'd like to run the pre-migration manually without Docker, you can do so by running the migration tool from source:

1. Stop your node.

2. Checkout and build migration script.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/celo-org/optimism.git
    cd optimism/op-chain-ops
    make celo-migrate
    ```

3. Run the pre-migration.

    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/celo-migrate pre \
    --old-db <path-to-your-L1-datadir>/celo/chaindata \
    --new-db <path-to-your-L2-destination-datadir>/geth/chaindata
    ```

Once the pre-migration is complete, you can start your L1 node again. The pre-migration may take several hours to complete.

#### Notes

* You can repeat this process as many times as needed leading up to the full migration. We highly recommend pre-migrating at least once for mainnet, as migrating mainnet chaindata can take over 2 hours.

* When you run the full migration, you must use the same destination datadir in order to benefit from the pre-migration.

* The full migration will also run a pre-migration, so you will see logs from the pre-migration when running the full migration even if you already ran a pre-migration.
