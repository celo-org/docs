## For node operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to the respective releases before the activation dates and potentially migrate their state database. See the [Node Operator Guide](../l2-operator-guide.md) for detailed information.

These following versions are necessary for every node operator:

* Alfajores testnet
  * `op-node` at `vTBD`
  * `op-geth` at `vTBD`
* Baklava testnet
  * `op-node` at `vTBD`
  * `op-geth` at `vTBD`
