# Registering as RPC provider

This documents gives step-by-step instructions about how to register a RPC node on chain to be eligible for rewards, for an overview of how elections work visit [How it works](how-it-works)

:::info
The name "validator" is legacy, as it was used for Celo Validators when Celo was an L1. It is still used in this guide because the smart contracts still reference it.
:::

## Prerequisites

### Software requirements

Celo CLI needs to be installed in your local. See [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/) for instructions on how to get set up.

:::info

Make sure to be in node version 18 or higher.

:::

### Staking Requirements

The current requirement is 10,000 CELO to register a RPC node, and 10,000 CELO _per member RPC_ to register a RPC Group.

If you do not have the required CELO to lock up, you can try out the process of creating a validator on the [Alfajores](/network/alfajores) or [Baklava](/network/baklava) testnets. There is a faucet for these [networks available](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores). RPC providers should use the "Advanced Needs" form.


### Key Management
:::danger
Private keys are the central primitive of any cryptographic system and need to be handled with extreme care. Loss of your private key can lead to irreversible loss of assets.
:::

This guide contains a large number of keys, so it is important to understand the purpose of each key. [Read more about key management.](/what-is-celo/about-celo-l1/validator/key-management/summary)

### Summary of keys involved

##### Account and Signer keys

Running a RPC node requires the management of several different keys, each with different privileges. Keys that need to be accessed frequently (e.g. for changing URLs) are at greater risk of being compromised, and thus have more limited permissions, while keys that need to be accessed infrequently (e.g. for locking CELO) are less onerous to store securely, and thus have more expansive permissions. Below is a summary of the various keys that are used in the Celo network, and a description of their permissions.

| Name of the key        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account key            | This is the key with the highest level of permissions, and is thus the most sensitive. It can be used to lock and unlock CELO, and authorize vote, validator, and attestation keys. Note that the account key also has all of the permissions of the other keys. |
| Validator signer key   | This is the key that has permission to register and manage a node or a Group.                                                                                                                                     |
| Vote signer key        | This key can be used to vote in Validator elections and on-chain governance.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

In this guide, the following addresses will be used:

| Address name           | Purpose                                                                                                | Owner entity  | Recommended storage |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS     | Address representing a group, with up to five nodes. It's the account that will receive votes.         | Group         | Cold                |
| CELO_NODE_ADDRESS      | Address that represent a node.                                                                         | Node          | Cold                |
| CELO_VALIDATOR_SINGER* | Address authorized to generate signers or deregister members or join/leave a group. It can be rotated. | Node operator | Hot                 |


Groups and validators may be run by different entities. This guide assumes they are running by the same entity, but you can skip those if not relevant to your specific setup.


### Setting up accounts

This amount (10,000 CELO) represents the minimum amount needed to be locked in order to register a Validator and Validator group. **Note that you will want to be sure to leave enough CELO unlocked to be able to continue to pay transaction fees for future transactions (such as those issued by running some CLI commands)**.
Check that your CELO was successfully locked with the following commands:

```bash
$ celocli lockedcelo:show $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS
$ celocli lockedcelo:show $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
```


#### Set up the Group Account

##### Lock up CELO

Lock up CELO for both accounts in order to secure the right to register a Validator and Validator Group. The current requirement is 10,000 CELO to register a node. For nodes, this Celo remains locked for approximately 60 days following deregistration.


:::info

A note about conventions:
The code snippets you'll see on this page are bash commands and their output.

When you see text in angle brackets &lt;&gt;, replace them and the text inside with your own value of what it refers to. Don't include the &lt;&gt; in the command.

:::

```bash
$ celocli lockedcelo:lock --from $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --value 10000e18
```

:::info
The Celo CLI requires a RPC address to be used, you can specity the one run by Celo Community RPC with `-n https://rpc.celo-community.org`
:::

:::info
The Celo CLI can be used with a ledger with the Celo Ledger app as shown in the [CLI docs](/wallet/ledger/to-celo-cli). Alternatively, you can pass a private key directly with the `--privateKey` flag. Either of those can be used with any command that signs a transaction.
:::

#### Set up the Node Account

##### Lock up CELO

Lock up CELO with the  Group account. The current requirement is 10,000 CELO _per member node_ to register a Validator Group. For groups, this Celo approximately 180 days following the removal of the Nth validator from the group.

```bash
$ celocli lockedcelo:lock --from $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --value 10000e18
```


##### Create a Validator Signer

To actually register as a node, we'll need to generate a validating signer key. This account can be created in many ways, by exporting a private key from a wallet (like metamask), a hardware wallet or by running the following command:

```bash
# On the validator machine
$ celocli account:new
```

Make sure to store that key safetly.

##### Creating Validator Signer Proof-of-Possession


To actually register as a node, we need to create a proof that we have possession of the Validator signer private key. We do so by signing a message that consists of the Validator account address. 

```bash
$ celocli account:proof-of-possession --signer $CELO_VALIDATOR_SIGNER_ADDRESS --account $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
```

##### Register node metadata on-chain

Before running for elections, make sure to have the node metadata properly set, otherwise the node is at risk of getting slashed. Instructions can be found [here](./community-rpc-node#registering-the-node-url).

### Run for election

In order to be elected as a RPC provider, you will first need to register your group and the node itself. Note that when registering a Group, you need to specify a [commission](/what-is-celo/about-celo-l1/protocol/pos/validator-groups#group-share), which is the fraction of epoch rewards paid to the group by its members.
We don't want to use our account key for validating, so first let's authorize the validator signing key:

#### Authorize signer
```bash
$ celocli account:authorize --from $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --role validator --signature 0x$CELO_VALIDATOR_SIGNER_SIGNATURE --signer 0x$CELO_VALIDATOR_SIGNER_ADDRESS
```

Confirm by checking the authorized Validator signer for your Validator:

```bash
$ celocli account:show $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
```

#### Register group

Then, register your Group by running the following command. Note that because we did not authorize a Validator signer for our Validator Group account, we register the Validator Group with the account key.

```bash
$ celocli validatorgroup:register --from $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --commission 0.1
```

You can view information about your Validator Group by running the following command:

```bash
$ celocli validatorgroup:show $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS
```

#### Register the node

Next, register your Validator by running the following command. Note that because we have authorized a Validator signer, this step could also be performed on the Validator machine. Running it on the local machine allows us to avoid needing to install the [`
$ celocli`](https://docs.celo.org/cli) on the Validator machine.

```bash
$ celocli validator:register --from $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --ecdsaKey $CELO_VALIDATOR_SIGNER_PUBLIC_KEY --blsKey $CELO_VALIDATOR_SIGNER_BLS_PUBLIC_KEY --blsSignature $CELO_VALIDATOR_SIGNER_BLS_SIGNATURE
```

#### Affiliate the node to the group

Affiliate your Validator with your Validator Group. Note that you will not be a member of this group until the Validator Group accepts you. This command could also be run from the Validator signer, if running on the validator machine.

```bash
$ celocli validator:affiliate $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --from $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
```

Accept the affiliation:

```bash
$ celocli validatorgroup:member --accept $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --from $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS
```

Next, double check that your Validator is now a member of your Validator Group:

```bash
$ celocli validator:show $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
$ celocli validatorgroup:show $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS
```

### Voting

As an optional step, both accounts can be used to vote for your Group. Note that because we have not authorized a vote signer for either account, these transactions must be sent from the account keys.

:::info
You can only run these commands with the accounts you control, they are all listed here for simplicity.
:::

```bash
$ celocli election:vote --from $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --for $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --value 10000e18
$ celocli election:vote --from $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --for $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --value 10000e18
```

Double check that your votes were cast successfully:

```bash
$ celocli election:show $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --group
$ celocli election:show $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --voter
$ celocli election:show $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --voter
```

##### Activating the votes

Users voting in the Celo protocol receive epoch rewards for voting in Elections only after submitting a special transaction to enable them. This must be done every time new votes are cast, and can only be made after the most recent epoch has ended. For convenience, we can use the following command, which will wait until the epoch has ended before sending a transaction:

```bash
# Note that this may take some time, as the epoch needs to end before votes can be activated
$ celocli election:activate --from $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --wait && 
$ celocli election:activate --from $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --wait
```

Check that your votes were activated by re-running the following commands:

```bash
$ celocli election:show $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS --voter
$ celocli election:show $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS --voter
```

#### Election

You're all set! Elections are finalized at the end of each epoch, roughly once a day in the Mainnet network. After that hour, if you get elected, your node will start participating BFT consensus and validating blocks. After the first epoch in which your Validator participates in BFT, you should receive your first set of epoch rewards.

Current election status, as well as the minimal amount of votes needed, can be seen on [Mondo](https://mondo.celo.org/).

You can inspect the current state of the validator elections by running the following command:

```bash
$ celocli election:list
```

You can check the status of your node, including whether it is elected, by running:

```bash
$ celocli validator:status --validator $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
```

You can see additional information about your node, including uptime score, by running:

```bash
$ celocli validator:show $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
```

#### Rewards

##### Celo

If your Validator Group elects validators, you will receive epoch rewards in the form of additional Locked CELO voting for your Validator Group from your account addresses. You can see these rewards accumulate with the commands in the previous set, as well as:

```bash
$ celocli lockedcelo:show $CELO_GROUP_ADDRESS
$ celocli lockedcelo:show $CELO_NODE_ADDRESS
```

##### cUSD

This cUSD reward is for active validators and is based on their validator score, calculated as part of the L2 epoch rewards process (see `EpochRewards.calculateTargetEpochRewards()`). For more details, refer to the [L2 Epoch Rewards documentation](../../what-is-celo/using-celo/protocol/epoch-rewards/index.md).

Instructions can be found [here](./community-rpc-node#claiming-rewards).
