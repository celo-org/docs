title: Withdrawing CELO from L2 to L1
---

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

In this tutorial, you will learn how to programmatically withdraw CELO from Celo Sepolia to Sepolia using the [viem OP Stack](https://viem.sh/op-stack).  

## Steps to Withdraw CELO

Withdrawals require the user to submit three transactions:

1. [Withdrawal initiating a transaction](https://viem.sh/op-stack/actions/initiateWithdrawal), which the user submits on L2.
2. [Withdrawal proving transaction](https://viem.sh/op-stack/actions/proveWithdrawal), which the user submits on L1 to prove that the withdrawal is legitimate.
3. [Withdrawal finalizing transaction](https://viem.sh/op-stack/actions/finalizeWithdrawal), which the user submits on L1 after the fault challenge period has passed, to actually run the transaction on L1.

## Code Example

The following example demonstrates how to configure a file with all the details you need for interacting with the Celo Sepolia.

    import {

    import { celoSepolia, sepolia } from "viem/chains";
    import {

      walletActionsL2,
      walletActionsL1,
      publicActionsL2,
    } from "viem/op-stack";

    const account = privateKeyToAccount(
      "[PRIVATE_KEY]",
    );

    const value = parseEther("0.0001"); // Amount to Withdraw
