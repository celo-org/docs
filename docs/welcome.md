## Celo's Mission

The company’s mission is to build a financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for everyone. Celo enables native and non-native digital assets–both cryptographic and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)–to circulate freely across devices, carriers, and countries. This makes money mobile, global and accessible like never before. Celo is supported by a community of organizations and individuals, including Jack Dorsey, a16z, and Deutsche Telekom.

## Celo Ecosystem

An Ethereum-compatible technology capable of reaching global users at scale, Celo turns crypto into usable money with a multi-asset system: a governance and staking asset (CELO) and a family of stablecoins. Since the launch of Mainnet in 2020, Celo’s network now supports 1000+ projects from builders, developers, and artists, who everyday create new applications and issue digital currencies from over 100 countries around the world.
