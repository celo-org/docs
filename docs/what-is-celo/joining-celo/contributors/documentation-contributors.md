## Why Documentation Matters

Documentation contributors play a vital role in the Celo ecosystem by creating clear, accessible resources that help users, developers, and community members understand and use Celo technology. High-quality documentation is essential for adoption, education, and the overall growth of the ecosystem.

Good documentation:

- **Lowers barriers to entry** for newcomers
- **Improves developer experience** and productivity
- **Empowers users** to solve problems independently
- **Supports the community** by reducing the support burden
- **Helps explain** Celo's vision and technical implementation

- Step-by-step tutorials for beginners
- How-to guides for specific tasks
- Troubleshooting guides and FAQs
- Explainer articles for key concepts

### 3. Documentation Maintenance
