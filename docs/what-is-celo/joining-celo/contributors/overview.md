# Celo Contributor Overview

Celo is open source and welcomes participation from everyone. We strive to fulfill our [Community Tenets](https://celo.org/community) by being inclusive and empowering. All contributors must abide by Celo's [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).

:::warning
As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo is no longer a standalone Layer 1 blockchainâ€”it is now an Ethereum Layer 2!
Some documentation may be outdated as updates are in progress. If you encounter issues, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/issues/new/choose).

For the most up-to-date information, refer to our [Celo L2 documentation](https://docs.celo.org/cel2).

## Ways to Contribute

Our community welcomes contributors with diverse skills:

- [**Code Contributors**](./code-contributors.md) - Developers who improve Celo's protocol and infrastructure
- [**CIP Contributors**](./cip-contributors.md) - Authors of Celo Improvement Proposals
- [**Documentation Contributors**](./documentation-contributors.md) - Writers who create and maintain technical documentation
- **Tutorial Authors** - Community members who share experiences and create educational content

## General Contribution Guidelines

Whether you're contributing code, documentation, or other content, these principles apply:

- **Fork the repository** - Always work in your own fork before submitting changes
- **Use PRs for changes** - Pull requests are preferred, especially for small changes like typos
- **Work in branches** - Use feature branches, not master/main, for ongoing work
- **Submit regularly** - For non-trivial work, submit PRs regularly to get feedback
- **Quality matters** - Double-check your work before submission
- **Be objective** - Remain fact-based and neutral in tone

## PR Best Practices

For effective contributions:

- Create meaningful PRs with clear descriptions
- For works in progress, use "WIP" in the title
- Request appropriate reviewers (check CODEOWNERS when unsure)
- Explain dependencies and breaking changes
- Include relevant tests and documentation updates

## Tutorial Contributions

Share your Celo experience through blog posts:

- Create files in the [blog directory](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/tree/main/blog) using format `YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.md`
- Include proper front matter (title, description, author info)
- Use `<!--truncate-->` to define post summaries
- For images, create a folder with the same naming convention containing your post (as index.md) and assets
