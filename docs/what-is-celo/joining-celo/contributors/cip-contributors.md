# Community Improvement Proposals

:::warning
As of block height 31,056,500 (March 26, 2025, 3:00 AM UTC), Celo is no longer a standalone Layer 1 blockchain—it is now an Ethereum Layer 2!
Some documentation may be outdated as updates are in progress. If you encounter issues, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/issues/new/choose).

For the most up-to-date information, refer to our [Celo L2 documentation](https://docs.celo.org/cel2).

Celo’s Improvement Proposals \(CIPs\) describe standards for the Celo platform, including the core protocol specifications, SDK, and contract standards. A CIP is a design document that should provide background information, a rationale for the proposal, detailed solution including technical specifications, and, if any, a list of potential risks. The proposer is responsible for soliciting community feedback and for driving consensus.

Participation in the Celo project is subject to the [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).

## Submitting CIPs

Draft all proposals following the template below and submit to the [CIPs repository](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals) via a PR \(pull request\).

CIP template:

- **Summary:** Describe your proposal in 280 characters or less.
- **Abstract**: Provide a short description of the technical issue being addressed.
- **Motivation:** Clearly explain why the proposed change should be made. It should layout the current Celo protocol shortcomings it addresses and why doing so is important.
- **Specification:** Define and explain in detail the technical requirements for new features and/or changes proposed.
- **Rationale**: Explain the reasoning behind your approach. It should cover alternative approaches considered, related work, and trade-offs made.
- **Implementation:** For all proposals going through the governance process, this section should reference the code implementing the proposed change. It’s recommended to get community feedback before writing any code.
- **Risks:** Highlight any risks and concerns that may affect consensus, proof-of-stake, governance, protocol economics, the stability protocol, security, and privacy.
