## What is the Community Fund?

The Community Fund supports the ongoing development and maintenance of the Celo platform. CELO holders collectively decide how to allocate these funds through governance proposals submitted to the [governance forum](https://forum.celo.org/c/governance/12).

## How the Community Fund Receives Assets

The Community Fund is funded through two primary mechanisms:

- **Epoch rewards**: the Community Fund receives 1% of epoch rewards, adjustable via governance and distributed automatically at each epoch.

- **Slashed assets**: the Community Fund is the default destination for slashed assets.

In April 2023, [CGP-79](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-79) was passed, enabling the Mento Reserve to return 120M CELO (originally allocated at genesis) to the Celo Community Fund.
