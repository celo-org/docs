# Celo Protocol

Introduction to the Celo protocol, its implementation, and its relationship to OP.

---

## What is the Celo Protocol?

Celo's L2 implementation is built on the OP-stack, Optimism's modular blockchain infrastructure. As an Ethereum Layer 2, Celo leverages the battle-tested OP-stack framework while maintaining its unique features and user experience. The project team acknowledges the Optimism community for providing this robust foundation and continues to contribute improvements where beneficial to the broader ecosystem.

The Celo protocol combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain services (such as phone number verification via SMS) to deliver its distinctive features. Several core components have evolved into standalone protocols, including Mento for stability mechanisms and Self for identity services.

## Protocol Features

Celo has implemented substantial enhancements and additions to serve its product goals, including the following:
