### Celo L2 Security Council Overview

- **Purpose**: 
  - To decentralize the Celo L2 Network.
  - Manage key upgrades and security fixes.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Upgrade L1 protocol contracts for Celo’s L2.
  - Modify designations for roles like sequencers, proposers, and challengers.
  - Execute urgent security fixes via hotfixes.
  - Act independently in urgent situations for the network's best interest.

- **Decentralization Goals**:
  - Prevent any single entity from upgrading the system, modifying rollup state, or censoring transactions.

- **Governance**:
  - Regular Governance Process for Celo Core Contracts and Community Fund remains unchanged.

- **Proposed Multisig Structure**:
  - **2/2 Safe Multisig**:
    - Members: cLabs Multisig and Celo Community Security Council.
      - **cLabs Multisig**: 4 out of 5 multisig with a 75% threshold.
      - **Celo Community Security Council**: 6/8 multisig with members from L2Beat, Hyperlane, Valora, Mento, Nitya Subramanian, Kris Kaczor, Tim Moreton, and Aaron Boyd.
    - Ensures non-cLabs controlled quorum-blocking group.

- **Security Standards**:
  - Follow Optimism multisig security policy.
  - Allow nested multisigs if all signers adhere to the security policy.
