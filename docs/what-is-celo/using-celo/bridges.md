# Bridges

Bridging allows users to transfer assets between the Celo network and other blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. This section provides an overview of available bridging and swapping options.

:::warning

Be sure you understand and review the risks when bridging assets between chains.

## Bridges To and From Celo

### Popular Bridges

- [Portal Bridge (Wormhole)](https://portalbridge.com/)
- [Squid Router V2](https://v2.app.squidrouter.com/?chains=10%2C42220&tokens=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee%2C0x471ece3750da237f93b8e339c536989b8978a438)
- [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/)
- [Jumper Exchange](https://jumper.exchange/?fromChain=10&fromToken=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000&toChain=42220&toToken=0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438)

### Gasless Bridges

- [SmolRefuel](https://smolrefuel.com/?outboundChain=42220)

### Native Bridges

:::info
Native Bridging is only possible once Celo has become an L2. For now you can test it on the Alfajores L2 testnet.

- Superbridge Celo Mainnet - **not released**
- [Superbridge Alfajores Testnet](https://testnets.superbridge.app/celo-alfajores)
- [Superbridge Baklava Testnet](https://testnets.superbridge.app/celo-baklava)

## Cross-Chain Messaging

In addition to token bridges, there are also protocols that enable cross-chain messaging and interoperability:

- [Chainlink CCIP](https://chain.link/cross-chain)
- [Hyperlane](https://www.hyperlane.xyz/)
- [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/)
- [Layer Zero](https://layerzero.network/)
- [Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/)
