# Bridges

Bridging allows users to transfer assets between the Celo network and other blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. This section provides an overview of available bridging and swapping options.

:::warning

Be sure you understand and review the risks when bridging assets between chains.

## Bridges To and From Celo

### Popular Bridges

### Native Bridges


Native bridging refers to the process of transferring assets directly between Layer 2 (L2) networks without the need for intermediary networks or tokens. This method is designed to be more secure, efficient and cost-effective, leveraging the security and scalability of L2 solutions.

## Cross-Chain Messaging

In addition to token bridges, there are also protocols that enable cross-chain messaging and interoperability:

- [Chainlink CCIP](https://chain.link/cross-chain)
- [Hyperlane](https://www.hyperlane.xyz/)
- [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/)
- [Layer Zero](https://layerzero.network/)
- [Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/)
