## Why Build on Celo?

Celo is fully EVM-compatible, offering the same development experience as Ethereum with improved scalability and lower costs.

#### Built for Everyday Users:

Celo is designed with features that lower the entry barrier for those new to cryptocurrency.

- **Fee Abstraction**: Users can pay transaction fees with several different tokens, making payments simple and flexible.
- **Sub-Cent Fees**: Celo maintains low gas fees, often below a cent, keeping transactions affordable.
- **Fast Transactions**: Celo achieves 1 second block finality, enabling near-instant transaction confirmations.
- **Native Stablecoins**: Celo provides native stablecoins like cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, eXOF, cKES, PUSO, and cCOP, offering a stable way to send and receive money. Check out [Mento](https://www.mento.org/) to learn more.
- **Token Duality**: CELO token is both the native currency of the Celo blockchain as well as an ERC20 compatible token. This means CELO tokens can be moved both by doing a native transfer as well as ERC20 transfers and will show up in both in the native account balance and the ERC20 balance, no matter how they were transferred. In contrast to ETH/WETH, no token wrapping or unwrapping is necessary.
- **Mobile-Focused Approach**: Celo is optimized for mobile devices, making blockchain accessible to billions of smartphone users worldwide.

#### Optimized for Global Reach:

- **Scalability**: Celo's focus on real-world use cases has already helped scale applications to over 250,000 daily active users (DAUs), proving its capability to support large-scale deployment.
- **Community Engagement**: Celo boasts an active global community of users and builders. With over 4 years of experience in bringing blockchain to real-world users, Celo offers a supportive environment for developers to test, launch, and scale their applications. Community members are engaged and eager to provide feedback, helping builders refine their products for broad, practical use.
