Oracles are essential components in blockchain ecosystems, acting as bridges that connect on-chain smart contracts with real-world data. They allow smart contracts to access information that exists outside the blockchain, such as financial market data, weather conditions, or other off-chain events. This capability is crucial because blockchains, by design, cannot access external data directly due to their isolated nature.

Here are lists of all on-chain Oracles:

- [RedStone Oracles](/what-is-celo/about-celo-l1/protocol/oracle/redstone)
