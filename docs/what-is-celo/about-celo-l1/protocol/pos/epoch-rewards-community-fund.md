Introduction to the community fund, its assets, and its relationship to the on-chain reserve.

## What is the Community Fund?

The Community Fund provides for the general upkeep of the Celo platform. CELO holders decide how to allocate these funds through governance proposals in the [governance forum](https://forum.celo.org/). Funds might be used to pay bounties for bugs or vulnerabilities, security audits, or grants for protocol development.

## Community Fund Assets

The Community Fund receives assets from two sources:

- The Community Fund obtains a desired epoch reward defined as a fraction of the total desired epoch rewards \(governable, initially planned to be $$25\%$$\). This amount is subject to adjustment up or down in the event of under- or over-spending against the epoch rewards target schedule.

- The Community Fund is the default destination for slashed assets.
