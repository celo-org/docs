# Overview

Celo was launched in 2020 as a mobile-first Layer 1 blockchain designed to advance global financial inclusion through smartphone-accessible crypto payments and phone number-based addressing. Built on proof-of-stake consensus with a commitment to carbon neutrality, Celo's L1 featured fast, low-cost transactions and native stablecoins like cUSD that powered a vibrant DeFi ecosystem.

In 2024, Celo began migrating from its Layer 1 architecture to become an Ethereum Layer 2 network built on the OP-Stack. This migration aimed to achieve greater scalability and interoperability while preserving Celo's core mission and complete transaction history.
The migration was completed in March 2025 at block 31,056,500.
